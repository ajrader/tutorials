       "'THE ONE AS MASTER, THE OTHER AS MAN   Mr. Phileas Fogg lived, in 1872, at No. 7, Saville Row, Burlington Gardens, the house in which Sheridan died in 1814.  He was one of the most noticeable members of the Reform Club, though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention; an enigmatical personage, about whom little was known, except that he was a polished man of the world.  People said that he resembled Byron--at least that his head was Byronic; but he was a bearded, tranquil Byron, who might live on a thousand years without growing old.  Certainly an Englishman, it was more doubtful whether Phileas Fogg was a Londoner.  He was never seen on \\'Change, nor at the Bank, nor in the counting-rooms of the \"City\"; no ships ever came into London docks of which he was the owner; he had no public employment; he had never been entered at any of the Inns of Court, either at the Temple, or Lincoln\\'s Inn, or Gray\\'s Inn; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of Chancery, or in the Exchequer, or the Queen\\'s Bench, or the Ecclesiastical Courts.  He certainly was not a manufacturer; nor was he a merchant or a gentleman farmer.  His name was strange to the scientific and learned societies, and he never was known to take part in the sage deliberations of the Royal Institution or the London Institution, the Artisan\\'s Association, or the Institution of Arts and Sciences.  He belonged, in fact, to none of the numerous societies which swarm in the English capital, from the Harmonic to that of the Entomologists, founded mainly for the purpose of abolishing pernicious insects.  Phileas Fogg was a member of the Reform, and that was all.  The way in which he got admission to this exclusive club was simple enough.  He was recommended by the Barings, with whom he had an open credit. His cheques were regularly paid at sight from his account current, which was always flush.  Was Phileas Fogg rich?  Undoubtedly.  But those who knew him best could not imagine how he had made his fortune, and Mr. Fogg was the last person to whom to apply for the information.  He was not lavish, nor, on the contrary, avaricious; for, whenever he knew that money was needed for a noble, useful, or benevolent purpose, he supplied it quietly and sometimes anonymously.  He was, in short, the least communicative of men.  He talked very little, and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner.  His daily habits were quite open to observation; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done before, that the wits of the curious were fairly puzzled.  Had he travelled?  It was likely, for no one seemed to know the world more familiarly; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it.  He often corrected, with a few clear words, the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the club as to lost and unheard-of travellers, pointing out the true probabilities, and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight, so often did events justify his predictions.  He must have travelled everywhere, at least in the spirit.  It was at least certain that Phileas Fogg had not absented himself from London for many years.  Those who were honoured by a better acquaintance with him than the rest, declared that nobody could pretend to have ever seen him anywhere else.  His sole pastimes were reading the papers and playing whist.  He often won at this game, which, as a silent one, harmonised with his nature; but his winnings never went into his purse, being reserved as a fund for his charities.  Mr. Fogg played, not to win, but for the sake of playing.  The game was in his eyes a contest, a struggle with a difficulty, yet a motionless, unwearying struggle, congenial to his tastes.  Phileas Fogg was not known to have either wife or children, which may happen to the most honest people; either relatives or near friends, which is certainly more unusual.  He lived alone in his house in Saville Row, whither none penetrated.  A single domestic sufficed to serve him.  He breakfasted and dined at the club, at hours mathematically fixed, in the same room, at the same table, never taking his meals with other members, much less bringing a guest with him; and went home at exactly midnight, only to retire at once to bed.  He never used the cosy chambers which the Reform provides for its favoured members.  He passed ten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row, either in sleeping or making his toilet.  When he chose to take a walk it was with a regular step in the entrance hall with its mosaic flooring, or in the circular gallery with its dome supported by twenty red porphyry Ionic columns, and illumined by blue painted windows. When he breakfasted or dined all the resources of the club--its kitchens and pantries, its buttery and dairy--aided to crowd his table with their most succulent stores; he was served by the gravest waiters, in dress coats, and shoes with swan-skin soles, who proffered the viands in special porcelain, and on the finest linen; club decanters, of a lost mould, contained his sherry, his port, and his cinnamon-spiced claret; while his beverages were refreshingly cooled with ice, brought at great cost from the American lakes.  If to live in this style is to be eccentric, it must be confessed that there is something good in eccentricity.  The mansion in Saville Row, though not sumptuous, was exceedingly comfortable.  The habits of its occupant were such as to demand but little from the sole domestic, but Phileas Fogg required him to be almost superhumanly prompt and regular.  On this very 2nd of October he had dismissed James Forster, because that luckless youth had brought him shaving-water at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit instead of eighty-six; and he was awaiting his successor, who was due at the house between eleven and half-past.  Phileas Fogg was seated squarely in his armchair, his feet close together like those of a grenadier on parade, his hands resting on his knees, his body straight, his head erect; he was steadily watching a complicated clock which indicated the hours, the minutes, the seconds, the days, the months, and the years.  At exactly half-past eleven Mr. Fogg would, according to his daily habit, quit Saville Row, and repair to the Reform.  A rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment where Phileas Fogg was seated, and James Forster, the dismissed servant, appeared.  \"The new servant,\" said he.  A young man of thirty advanced and bowed.  \"You are a Frenchman, I believe,\" asked Phileas Fogg, \"and your name is John?\"  \"Jean, if monsieur pleases,\" replied the newcomer, \"Jean Passepartout, a surname which has clung to me because I have a natural aptness for going out of one business into another.  I believe I\\'m honest, monsieur, but, to be outspoken, I\\'ve had several trades.  I\\'ve been an itinerant singer, a circus-rider, when I used to vault like Leotard, and dance on a rope like Blondin.  Then I got to be a professor of gymnastics, so as to make better use of my talents; and then I was a sergeant fireman at Paris, and assisted at many a big fire.  But I quitted France five years ago, and, wishing to taste the sweets of domestic life, took service as a valet here in England.  Finding myself out of place, and hearing that Monsieur Phileas Fogg was the most exact and settled gentleman in the United Kingdom, I have come to monsieur in the hope of living with him a tranquil life, and forgetting even the name of Passepartout.\"  \"Passepartout suits me,\" responded Mr. Fogg.  \"You are well recommended to me; I hear a good report of you.  You know my conditions?\"  \"Yes, monsieur.\"  \"Good!  What time is it?\"  \"Twenty-two minutes after eleven,\" returned Passepartout, drawing an enormous silver watch from the depths of his pocket.  \"You are too slow,\" said Mr. Fogg.  \"Pardon me, monsieur, it is impossible--\"  \"You are four minutes too slow.  No matter; it\\'s enough to mention the error.  Now from this moment, twenty-nine minutes after eleven, a.m., this Wednesday, 2nd October, you are in my service.\"  Phileas Fogg got up, took his hat in his left hand, put it on his head with an automatic motion, and went off without a word.  Passepartout heard the street door shut once; it was his new master going out.  He heard it shut again; it was his predecessor, James Forster, departing in his turn.  Passepartout remained alone in the house in Saville Row.   '"

       "'  Fix soon rejoined Passepartout, who was lounging and looking about on the quay, as if he did not feel that he, at least, was obliged not to see anything.  \"Well, my friend,\" said the detective, coming up with him, \"is your passport visaed?\"  \"Ah, it\\'s you, is it, monsieur?\" responded Passepartout.  \"Thanks, yes, the passport is all right.\"  \"And you are looking about you?\"  \"Yes; but we travel so fast that I seem to be journeying in a dream. So this is Suez?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"In Egypt?\"  \"Certainly, in Egypt.\"  \"And in Africa?\"  \"In Africa.\"  \"In Africa!\" repeated Passepartout.  \"Just think, monsieur, I had no idea that we should go farther than Paris; and all that I saw of Paris was between twenty minutes past seven and twenty minutes before nine in the morning, between the Northern and the Lyons stations, through the windows of a car, and in a driving rain!  How I regret not having seen once more Pere la Chaise and the circus in the Champs Elysees!\"  \"You are in a great hurry, then?\"  \"I am not, but my master is.  By the way, I must buy some shoes and shirts.  We came away without trunks, only with a carpet-bag.\"  \"I will show you an excellent shop for getting what you want.\"  \"Really, monsieur, you are very kind.\"  And they walked off together, Passepartout chatting volubly as they went along.  \"Above all,\" said he; \"don\\'t let me lose the steamer.\"  \"You have plenty of time; it\\'s only twelve o\\'clock.\"  Passepartout pulled out his big watch.  \"Twelve!\" he exclaimed; \"why, it\\'s only eight minutes before ten.\"  \"Your watch is slow.\"  \"My watch?  A family watch, monsieur, which has come down from my great-grandfather!  It doesn\\'t vary five minutes in the year.  It\\'s a perfect chronometer, look you.\"  \"I see how it is,\" said Fix.  \"You have kept London time, which is two hours behind that of Suez.  You ought to regulate your watch at noon in each country.\"  \"I regulate my watch?  Never!\"  \"Well, then, it will not agree with the sun.\"  \"So much the worse for the sun, monsieur.  The sun will be wrong, then!\"  And the worthy fellow returned the watch to its fob with a defiant gesture.  After a few minutes silence, Fix resumed: \"You left London hastily, then?\"  \"I rather think so!  Last Friday at eight o\\'clock in the evening, Monsieur Fogg came home from his club, and three-quarters of an hour afterwards we were off.\"  \"But where is your master going?\"  \"Always straight ahead.  He is going round the world.\"  \"Round the world?\" cried Fix.  \"Yes, and in eighty days!  He says it is on a wager; but, between us, I don\\'t believe a word of it.  That wouldn\\'t be common sense.  There\\'s something else in the wind.\"  \"Ah!  Mr. Fogg is a character, is he?\"  \"I should say he was.\"  \"Is he rich?\"  \"No doubt, for he is carrying an enormous sum in brand new banknotes with him.  And he doesn\\'t spare the money on the way, either: he has offered a large reward to the engineer of the Mongolia if he gets us to Bombay well in advance of time.\"  \"And you have known your master a long time?\"  \"Why, no; I entered his service the very day we left London.\"  The effect of these replies upon the already suspicious and excited detective may be imagined.  The hasty departure from London soon after the robbery; the large sum carried by Mr. Fogg; his eagerness to reach distant countries; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet--all confirmed Fix in his theory.  He continued to pump poor Passepartout, and learned that he really knew little or nothing of his master, who lived a solitary existence in London, was said to be rich, though no one knew whence came his riches, and was mysterious and impenetrable in his affairs and habits.  Fix felt sure that Phileas Fogg would not land at Suez, but was really going on to Bombay.  \"Is Bombay far from here?\" asked Passepartout.  \"Pretty far.  It is a ten days\\' voyage by sea.\"  \"And in what country is Bombay?\"  \"India.\"  \"In Asia?\"  \"Certainly.\"  \"The deuce!  I was going to tell you there\\'s one thing that worries me--my burner!\"  \"What burner?\"  \"My gas-burner, which I forgot to turn off, and which is at this moment burning at my expense.  I have calculated, monsieur, that I lose two shillings every four and twenty hours, exactly sixpence more than I earn; and you will understand that the longer our journey--\"  Did Fix pay any attention to Passepartout\\'s trouble about the gas?  It is not probable.  He was not listening, but was cogitating a project. Passepartout and he had now reached the shop, where Fix left his companion to make his purchases, after recommending him not to miss the steamer, and hurried back to the consulate.  Now that he was fully convinced, Fix had quite recovered his equanimity.  \"Consul,\" said he, \"I have no longer any doubt.  I have spotted my man. He passes himself off as an odd stick who is going round the world in eighty days.\"  \"Then he\\'s a sharp fellow,\" returned the consul, \"and counts on returning to London after putting the police of the two countries off his track.\"  \"We\\'ll see about that,\" replied Fix.  \"But are you not mistaken?\"  \"I am not mistaken.\"  \"Why was this robber so anxious to prove, by the visa, that he had passed through Suez?\"  \"Why?  I have no idea; but listen to me.\"  He reported in a few words the most important parts of his conversation with Passepartout.  \"In short,\" said the consul, \"appearances are wholly against this man. And what are you going to do?\"  \"Send a dispatch to London for a warrant of arrest to be dispatched instantly to Bombay, take passage on board the Mongolia, follow my rogue to India, and there, on English ground, arrest him politely, with my warrant in my hand, and my hand on his shoulder.\"  Having uttered these words with a cool, careless air, the detective took leave of the consul, and repaired to the telegraph office, whence he sent the dispatch which we have seen to the London police office.  A quarter of an hour later found Fix, with a small bag in his hand, proceeding on board the Mongolia; and, ere many moments longer, the noble steamer rode out at full steam upon the waters of the Red Sea.

Conan Doyle\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 1. Mr. Sherlock Holmes\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save\\r\\nupon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated\\r\\nat the breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the\\r\\nstick which our visitor had left behind him the night before. It was a\\r\\nfine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as\\r\\na \"Penang lawyer.\" Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly\\r\\nan inch across. \"To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the\\r\\nC.C.H.,\" was engraved upon it, with the date \"1884.\" It was just such a\\r\\nstick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry--dignified,\\r\\nsolid, and reassuring.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of\\r\\nmy occupation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the back\\r\\nof your head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of\\r\\nme,\" said he. \"But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor\\'s\\r\\nstick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no\\r\\nnotion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance.\\r\\nLet me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think,\" said I, following as far as I could the methods of my\\r\\ncompanion, \"that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man,\\r\\nwell-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their\\r\\nappreciation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good!\" said Holmes. \"Excellent!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country\\r\\npractitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so\\r\\nknocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it.\\r\\nThe thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a\\r\\ngreat amount of walking with it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perfectly sound!\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then again, there is the \\'friends of the C.C.H.\\' I should guess\\r\\nthat to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has\\r\\npossibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small\\r\\npresentation in return.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, Watson, you excel yourself,\" said Holmes, pushing back his\\r\\nchair and lighting a cigarette. \"I am bound to say that in all the\\r\\naccounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small\\r\\nachievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities. It may\\r\\nbe that you are not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of\\r\\nlight. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of\\r\\nstimulating it. I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much in your\\r\\ndebt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words gave\\r\\nme keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my\\r\\nadmiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to\\r\\nhis methods. I was proud, too, to think that I had so far mastered his\\r\\nsystem as to apply it in a way which earned his approval. He now took\\r\\nthe stick from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked\\r\\neyes. Then with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette,\\r\\nand carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a\\r\\nconvex lens.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Interesting, though elementary,\" said he as he returned to his\\r\\nfavourite corner of the settee. \"There are certainly one or two\\r\\nindications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several\\r\\ndeductions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has anything escaped me?\" I asked with some self-importance. \"I trust\\r\\nthat there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were\\r\\nerroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that\\r\\nin noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth.\\r\\nNot that you are entirely wrong in this instance. The man is certainly a\\r\\ncountry practitioner. And he walks a good deal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I was right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To that extent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that was all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, my dear Watson, not all--by no means all. I would suggest, for\\r\\nexample, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a\\r\\nhospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials \\'C.C.\\' are placed\\r\\nbefore that hospital the words \\'Charing Cross\\' very naturally suggest\\r\\nthemselves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may be right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a\\r\\nworking hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our\\r\\nconstruction of this unknown visitor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, supposing that \\'C.C.H.\\' does stand for \\'Charing Cross\\r\\nHospital,\\' what further inferences may we draw?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised\\r\\nin town before going to the country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it\\r\\nin this light. On what occasion would it be most probable that such a\\r\\npresentation would be made? When would his friends unite to give him\\r\\na pledge of their good will? Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer\\r\\nwithdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice\\r\\nfor himself. We know there has been a presentation. We believe there has\\r\\nbeen a change from a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then,\\r\\nstretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the\\r\\noccasion of the change?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It certainly seems probable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the\\r\\nhospital, since only a man well-established in a London practice could\\r\\nhold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country.\\r\\nWhat was he, then? If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he\\r\\ncould only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician--little more\\r\\nthan a senior student. And he left five years ago--the date is on the\\r\\nstick. So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into\\r\\nthin air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty,\\r\\namiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite\\r\\ndog, which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and\\r\\nsmaller than a mastiff.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee and\\r\\nblew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,\" said I, \"but\\r\\nat least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the\\r\\nman\\'s age and professional career.\" From my small medical shelf I took\\r\\ndown the Medical Directory and turned up the name. There were several\\r\\nMortimers, but only one who could be our visitor. I read his record\\r\\naloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n        \"Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.\\r\\n        House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital.\\r\\n        Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology,\\r\\n        with essay entitled \\'Is Disease a Reversion?\\'  Corresponding\\r\\n        member of the Swedish Pathological Society.  Author of\\r\\n        \\'Some Freaks of Atavism\\' (Lancet 1882).  \\'Do We Progress?\\'\\r\\n        (Journal of Psychology, March, 1883).  Medical Officer\\r\\n        for the parishes of Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No mention of that local hunt, Watson,\" said Holmes with a mischievous\\r\\nsmile, \"but a country doctor, as you very astutely observed. I think\\r\\nthat I am fairly justified in my inferences. As to the adjectives, I\\r\\nsaid, if I remember right, amiable, unambitious, and absent-minded.\\r\\nIt is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who\\r\\nreceives testimonials, only an unambitious one who abandons a London\\r\\ncareer for the country, and only an absent-minded one who leaves his\\r\\nstick and not his visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the dog?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master. Being a\\r\\nheavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle, and the marks of\\r\\nhis teeth are very plainly visible. The dog\\'s jaw, as shown in the space\\r\\nbetween these marks, is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not\\r\\nbroad enough for a mastiff. It may have been--yes, by Jove, it is a\\r\\ncurly-haired spaniel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the recess\\r\\nof the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his voice that I\\r\\nglanced up in surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very\\r\\ndoor-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don\\'t move, I beg you,\\r\\nWatson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be\\r\\nof assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment of fate, Watson, when\\r\\nyou hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you\\r\\nknow not whether for good or ill. What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man\\r\\nof science, ask of Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had expected\\r\\na typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin man, with a\\r\\nlong nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, gray eyes,\\r\\nset closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of\\r\\ngold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly\\r\\nfashion, for his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. Though\\r\\nyoung, his long back was already bowed, and he walked with a forward\\r\\nthrust of his head and a general air of peering benevolence. As he\\r\\nentered his eyes fell upon the stick in Holmes\\'s hand, and he ran\\r\\ntowards it with an exclamation of joy. \"I am so very glad,\" said he.\\r\\n\"I was not sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I\\r\\nwould not lose that stick for the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A presentation, I see,\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From Charing Cross Hospital?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear, dear, that\\'s bad!\" said Holmes, shaking his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment. \"Why was\\r\\nit bad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your marriage,\\r\\nyou say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all hopes of\\r\\na consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home of my own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,\" said Holmes. \"And now,\\r\\nDr. James Mortimer--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mister, sir, Mister--a humble M.R.C.S.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And a man of precise mind, evidently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the shores\\r\\nof the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr. Sherlock Holmes\\r\\nwhom I am addressing and not--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, this is my friend Dr. Watson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in connection\\r\\nwith that of your friend. You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes. I\\r\\nhad hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked\\r\\nsupra-orbital development. Would you have any objection to my running my\\r\\nfinger along your parietal fissure? A cast of your skull, sir, until\\r\\nthe original is available, would be an ornament to any anthropological\\r\\nmuseum. It is not my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet\\r\\nyour skull.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. \"You are an\\r\\nenthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in\\r\\nmine,\" said he. \"I observe from your forefinger that you make your own\\r\\ncigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other\\r\\nwith surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers as agile and\\r\\nrestless as the antennae of an insect.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the interest\\r\\nwhich he took in our curious companion. \"I presume, sir,\" said he at\\r\\nlast, \"that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that\\r\\nyou have done me the honour to call here last night and again today?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of doing\\r\\nthat as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I recognized that I am\\r\\nmyself an unpractical man and because I am suddenly confronted with a\\r\\nmost serious and extraordinary problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you\\r\\nare the second highest expert in Europe--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?\" asked\\r\\nHolmes with some asperity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon\\r\\nmust always appeal strongly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then had you not better consult him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a practical man\\r\\nof affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. I trust, sir, that I\\r\\nhave not inadvertently--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just a little,\" said Holmes. \"I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would do\\r\\nwisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the\\r\\nexact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 2. The Curse of the Baskervilles\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have in my pocket a manuscript,\" said Dr. James Mortimer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I observed it as you entered the room,\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is an old manuscript.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you say that, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time\\r\\nthat you have been talking. It would be a poor expert who could not give\\r\\nthe date of a document within a decade or so. You may possibly have read\\r\\nmy little monograph upon the subject. I put that at 1730.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The exact date is 1742.\" Dr. Mortimer drew it from his breast-pocket.\\r\\n\"This family paper was committed to my care by Sir Charles Baskerville,\\r\\nwhose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much\\r\\nexcitement in Devonshire. I may say that I was his personal friend as\\r\\nwell as his medical attendant. He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd,\\r\\npractical, and as unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this\\r\\ndocument very seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end\\r\\nas did eventually overtake him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon\\r\\nhis knee. \"You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the long s\\r\\nand the short. It is one of several indications which enabled me to fix\\r\\nthe date.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script. At\\r\\nthe head was written: \"Baskerville Hall,\" and below in large, scrawling\\r\\nfigures: \"1742.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It appears to be a statement of some sort.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the\\r\\nBaskerville family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I understand that it is something more modern and practical upon\\r\\nwhich you wish to consult me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be decided\\r\\nwithin twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and is intimately\\r\\nconnected with the affair. With your permission I will read it to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and\\r\\nclosed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer turned the\\r\\nmanuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking voice the following\\r\\ncurious, old-world narrative:\\r\\n\\r\\n        \"Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there\\r\\n        have been many statements, yet as I come in a direct\\r\\n        line from Hugo Baskerville, and as I had the story from\\r\\n        my father, who also had it from his, I have set it down\\r\\n        with all belief that it occurred even as is here set\\r\\n        forth.  And I would have you believe, my sons, that the\\r\\n        same Justice which punishes sin may also most graciously\\r\\n        forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer\\r\\n        and repentance it may be removed.  Learn then from this\\r\\n        story not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to\\r\\n        be circumspect in the future, that those foul passions\\r\\n        whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not\\r\\n        again be loosed to our undoing.\\r\\n\\r\\n        \"Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the\\r\\n        history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most\\r\\n        earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of\\r\\n        Baskerville was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be\\r\\n        gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and godless\\r\\n        man.  This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned,\\r\\n        seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts,\\r\\n        but there was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour\\r\\n        which made his name a by-word through the West.  It\\r\\n        chanced that this Hugo came to love (if, indeed, so dark\\r\\n        a passion may be known under so bright a name) the daughter\\r\\n        of a yeoman who held lands near the Baskerville estate.\\r\\n        But the young maiden, being discreet and of good repute,\\r\\n        would ever avoid him, for she feared his evil name.  So\\r\\n        it came to pass that one Michaelmas this Hugo, with five\\r\\n        or six of his idle and wicked companions, stole down upon\\r\\n        the farm and carried off the maiden, her father and\\r\\n        brothers being from home, as he well knew.  When they had\\r\\n        brought her to the Hall the maiden was placed in an upper\\r\\n        chamber, while Hugo and his friends sat down to a long\\r\\n        carouse, as was their nightly custom.  Now, the poor lass\\r\\n        upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing\\r\\n        and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from\\r\\n        below, for they say that the words used by Hugo Baskerville,\\r\\n        when he was in wine, were such as might blast the man who\\r\\n        said them.  At last in the stress of her fear she did that\\r\\n        which might have daunted the bravest or most active man,\\r\\n        for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered (and\\r\\n        still covers) the south wall she came down from under the\\r\\n        eaves, and so homeward across the moor, there being three\\r\\n        leagues betwixt the Hall and her father\\'s farm.\\r\\n\\r\\n        \"It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his\\r\\n        guests to carry food and drink--with other worse things,\\r\\n        perchance--to his captive, and so found the cage empty\\r\\n        and the bird escaped.  Then, as it would seem, he became\\r\\n        as one that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs\\r\\n        into the dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table,\\r\\n        flagons and trenchers flying before him, and he cried\\r\\n        aloud before all the company that he would that very\\r\\n        night render his body and soul to the Powers of Evil if\\r\\n        he might but overtake the wench.  And while the revellers\\r\\n        stood aghast at the fury of the man, one more wicked or,\\r\\n        it may be, more drunken than the rest, cried out that\\r\\n        they should put the hounds upon her.  Whereat Hugo ran\\r\\n        from the house, crying to his grooms that they should\\r\\n        saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and giving the\\r\\n        hounds a kerchief of the maid\\'s, he swung them to the\\r\\n        line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor.\\r\\n\\r\\n        \"Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable\\r\\n        to understand all that had been done in such haste.  But\\r\\n        anon their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed\\r\\n        which was like to be done upon the moorlands.  Everything\\r\\n        was now in an uproar, some calling for their pistols,\\r\\n        some for their horses, and some for another flask of\\r\\n        wine.  But at length some sense came back to their crazed\\r\\n        minds, and the whole of them, thirteen in number, took\\r\\n        horse and started in pursuit.  The moon shone clear above\\r\\n        them, and they rode swiftly abreast, taking that course\\r\\n        which the maid must needs have taken if she were to reach\\r\\n        her own home.\\r\\n\\r\\n        \"They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the\\r\\n        night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to\\r\\n        him to know if he had seen the hunt.  And the man, as\\r\\n        the story goes, was so crazed with fear that he could\\r\\n        scarce speak, but at last he said that he had indeed seen\\r\\n        the unhappy maiden, with the hounds upon her track.  \\'But\\r\\n        I have seen more than that,\\' said he, \\'for Hugo Baskerville\\r\\n        passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind\\r\\n        him such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at\\r\\n        my heels.\\'  So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd\\r\\n        and rode onward.  But soon their skins turned cold, for\\r\\n        there came a galloping across the moor, and the black\\r\\n        mare, dabbled with white froth, went past with trailing\\r\\n        bridle and empty saddle.  Then the revellers rode close\\r\\n        together, for a great fear was on them, but they still\\r\\n        followed over the moor, though each, had he been alone,\\r\\n        would have been right glad to have turned his horse\\'s\\r\\n        head.  Riding slowly in this fashion they came at last\\r\\n        upon the hounds.  These, though known for their valour\\r\\n        and their breed, were whimpering in a cluster at the\\r\\n        head of a deep dip or goyal, as we call it, upon the\\r\\n        moor, some slinking away and some, with starting hackles\\r\\n        and staring eyes, gazing down the narrow valley before them.\\r\\n\\r\\n        \"The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you\\r\\n        may guess, than when they started.  The most of them\\r\\n        would by no means advance, but three of them, the boldest,\\r\\n        or it may be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal.\\r\\n        Now, it opened into a broad space in which stood two of\\r\\n        those great stones, still to be seen there, which were\\r\\n        set by certain forgotten peoples in the days of old.\\r\\n        The moon was shining bright upon the clearing, and there\\r\\n        in the centre lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen,\\r\\n        dead of fear and of fatigue.  But it was not the sight\\r\\n        of her body, nor yet was it that of the body of Hugo\\r\\n        Baskerville lying near her, which raised the hair upon\\r\\n        the heads of these three dare-devil roysterers, but it\\r\\n        was that, standing over Hugo, and plucking at his throat,\\r\\n        there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast, shaped\\r\\n        like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal\\r\\n        eye has rested upon.  And even as they looked the thing\\r\\n        tore the throat out of Hugo Baskerville, on which, as it\\r\\n        turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the\\r\\n        three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life, still\\r\\n        screaming, across the moor.  One, it is said, died that\\r\\n        very night of what he had seen, and the other twain were\\r\\n        but broken men for the rest of their days.\\r\\n\\r\\n        \"Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound\\r\\n        which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever\\r\\n        since.  If I have set it down it is because that which\\r\\n        is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but\\r\\n        hinted at and guessed.  Nor can it be denied that many\\r\\n        of the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which\\r\\n        have been sudden, bloody, and mysterious.  Yet may we\\r\\n        shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence,\\r\\n        which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that\\r\\n        third or fourth generation which is threatened in Holy\\r\\n        Writ.  To that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend\\r\\n        you, and I counsel you by way of caution to forbear from\\r\\n        crossing the moor in those dark hours when the powers of\\r\\n        evil are exalted.\\r\\n\\r\\n        \"[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John,\\r\\n        with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their\\r\\n        sister Elizabeth.]\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed\\r\\nhis spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the\\r\\nfire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you not find it interesting?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To a collector of fairy tales.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more recent. This\\r\\nis the Devon County Chronicle of May 14th of this year. It is a short\\r\\naccount of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Charles Baskerville\\r\\nwhich occurred a few days before that date.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent. Our\\r\\nvisitor readjusted his glasses and began:\\r\\n\\r\\n        \"The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose\\r\\n        name has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate\\r\\n        for Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over\\r\\n        the county.  Though Sir Charles had resided at Baskerville\\r\\n        Hall for a comparatively short period his amiability of\\r\\n        character and extreme generosity had won the affection\\r\\n        and respect of all who had been brought into contact with\\r\\n        him.  In these days of nouveaux riches it is refreshing\\r\\n        to find a case where the scion of an old county family\\r\\n        which has fallen upon evil days is able to make his own\\r\\n        fortune and to bring it back with him to restore the\\r\\n        fallen grandeur of his line.  Sir Charles, as is well known,\\r\\n        made large sums of money in South African speculation.\\r\\n        More wise than those who go on until the wheel turns\\r\\n        against them, he realized his gains and returned to England\\r\\n        with them.  It is only two years since he took up his\\r\\n        residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how\\r\\n        large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement\\r\\n        which have been interrupted by his death.  Being himself\\r\\n        childless, it was his openly expressed desire that the\\r\\n        whole countryside should, within his own lifetime, profit\\r\\n        by his good fortune, and many will have personal reasons\\r\\n        for bewailing his untimely end.  His generous donations\\r\\n        to local and county charities have been frequently\\r\\n        chronicled in these columns.\\r\\n\\r\\n        \"The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles\\r\\n        cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the\\r\\n        inquest, but at least enough has been done to dispose of\\r\\n        those rumours to which local superstition has given rise.\\r\\n        There is no reason whatever to suspect foul play, or to\\r\\n        imagine that death could be from any but natural causes.\\r\\n        Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to\\r\\n        have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind.\\r\\n        In spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his\\r\\n        personal tastes, and his indoor servants at Baskerville\\r\\n        Hall consisted of a married couple named Barrymore, the\\r\\n        husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper.\\r\\n        Their evidence, corroborated by that of several friends,\\r\\n        tends to show that Sir Charles\\'s health has for some time\\r\\n        been impaired, and points especially to some affection\\r\\n        of the heart, manifesting itself in changes of colour,\\r\\n        breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous depression.\\r\\n        Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of\\r\\n        the deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.\\r\\n\\r\\n        \"The facts of the case are simple.  Sir Charles Baskerville\\r\\n        was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking\\r\\n        down the famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall.  The evidence\\r\\n        of the Barrymores shows that this had been his custom.\\r\\n        On the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his intention\\r\\n        of starting next day for London, and had ordered Barrymore\\r\\n        to prepare his luggage.  That night he went out as usual\\r\\n        for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in\\r\\n        the habit of smoking a cigar.  He never returned.  At\\r\\n        twelve o\\'clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still open,\\r\\n        became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in search\\r\\n        of his master.  The day had been wet, and Sir Charles\\'s\\r\\n        footmarks were easily traced down the alley.  Halfway down\\r\\n        this walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor.\\r\\n        There were indications that Sir Charles had stood for some\\r\\n        little time here.  He then proceeded down the alley, and\\r\\n        it was at the far end of it that his body was discovered.\\r\\n        One fact which has not been explained is the statement\\r\\n        of Barrymore that his master\\'s footprints altered their\\r\\n        character from the time that he passed the moor-gate, and\\r\\n        that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking\\r\\n        upon his toes.  One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was on\\r\\n        the moor at no great distance at the time, but he appears\\r\\n        by his own confession to have been the worse for drink.\\r\\n        He declares that he heard cries but is unable to state\\r\\n        from what direction they came.  No signs of violence were\\r\\n        to be discovered upon Sir Charles\\'s person, and though\\r\\n        the doctor\\'s evidence pointed to an almost incredible\\r\\n        facial distortion--so great that Dr. Mortimer refused at\\r\\n        first to believe that it was indeed his friend and patient\\r\\n        who lay before him--it was explained that that is a symptom\\r\\n        which is not unusual in cases of dyspnoea and death from\\r\\n        cardiac exhaustion.  This explanation was borne out by\\r\\n        the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing\\r\\n        organic disease, and the coroner\\'s jury returned a\\r\\n        verdict in accordance with the medical evidence.  It is\\r\\n        well that this is so, for it is obviously of the utmost\\r\\n        importance that Sir Charles\\'s heir should settle at the\\r\\n        Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly\\r\\n        interrupted.  Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not\\r\\n        finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been\\r\\n        whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been\\r\\n        difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall.  It is\\r\\n        understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville,\\r\\n        if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville\\'s\\r\\n        younger brother.  The young man when last heard of was\\r\\n        in America, and inquiries are being instituted with a\\r\\n        view to informing him of his good fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket. \"Those\\r\\nare the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the death of Sir\\r\\nCharles Baskerville.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must thank you,\" said Sherlock Holmes, \"for calling my attention to a\\r\\ncase which certainly presents some features of interest. I had observed\\r\\nsome newspaper comment at the time, but I was exceedingly preoccupied\\r\\nby that little affair of the Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige\\r\\nthe Pope I lost touch with several interesting English cases. This\\r\\narticle, you say, contains all the public facts?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then let me have the private ones.\" He leaned back, put his finger-tips\\r\\ntogether, and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In doing so,\" said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of some\\r\\nstrong emotion, \"I am telling that which I have not confided to anyone.\\r\\nMy motive for withholding it from the coroner\\'s inquiry is that a man of\\r\\nscience shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming\\r\\nto indorse a popular superstition. I had the further motive that\\r\\nBaskerville Hall, as the paper says, would certainly remain untenanted\\r\\nif anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation.\\r\\nFor both these reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather\\r\\nless than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but with\\r\\nyou there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near each other\\r\\nare thrown very much together. For this reason I saw a good deal of\\r\\nSir Charles Baskerville. With the exception of Mr. Frankland, of Lafter\\r\\nHall, and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist, there are no other men of\\r\\neducation within many miles. Sir Charles was a retiring man, but the\\r\\nchance of his illness brought us together, and a community of interests\\r\\nin science kept us so. He had brought back much scientific information\\r\\nfrom South Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together\\r\\ndiscussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that\\r\\nSir Charles\\'s nervous system was strained to the breaking point. He had\\r\\ntaken this legend which I have read you exceedingly to heart--so much\\r\\nso that, although he would walk in his own grounds, nothing would induce\\r\\nhim to go out upon the moor at night. Incredible as it may appear to\\r\\nyou, Mr. Holmes, he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung\\r\\nhis family, and certainly the records which he was able to give of\\r\\nhis ancestors were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence\\r\\nconstantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has asked me\\r\\nwhether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange\\r\\ncreature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter question he put\\r\\nto me several times, and always with a voice which vibrated with\\r\\nexcitement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some three\\r\\nweeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be at his hall door. I had\\r\\ndescended from my gig and was standing in front of him, when I saw\\r\\nhis eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an\\r\\nexpression of the most dreadful horror. I whisked round and had just\\r\\ntime to catch a glimpse of something which I took to be a large black\\r\\ncalf passing at the head of the drive. So excited and alarmed was he\\r\\nthat I was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been\\r\\nand look around for it. It was gone, however, and the incident appeared\\r\\nto make the worst impression upon his mind. I stayed with him all the\\r\\nevening, and it was on that occasion, to explain the emotion which he\\r\\nhad shown, that he confided to my keeping that narrative which I read to\\r\\nyou when first I came. I mention this small episode because it assumes\\r\\nsome importance in view of the tragedy which followed, but I was\\r\\nconvinced at the time that the matter was entirely trivial and that his\\r\\nexcitement had no justification.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London. His\\r\\nheart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in which he lived,\\r\\nhowever chimerical the cause of it might be, was evidently having a\\r\\nserious effect upon his health. I thought that a few months among the\\r\\ndistractions of town would send him back a new man. Mr. Stapleton, a\\r\\nmutual friend who was much concerned at his state of health, was of the\\r\\nsame opinion. At the last instant came this terrible catastrophe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the night of Sir Charles\\'s death Barrymore the butler, who made\\r\\nthe discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me, and as I was\\r\\nsitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of\\r\\nthe event. I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned\\r\\nat the inquest. I followed the footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the\\r\\nspot at the moor-gate where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the\\r\\nchange in the shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there\\r\\nwere no other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and\\r\\nfinally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until\\r\\nmy arrival. Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his fingers dug\\r\\ninto the ground, and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to\\r\\nsuch an extent that I could hardly have sworn to his identity. There was\\r\\ncertainly no physical injury of any kind. But one false statement was\\r\\nmade by Barrymore at the inquest. He said that there were no traces\\r\\nupon the ground round the body. He did not observe any. But I did--some\\r\\nlittle distance off, but fresh and clear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Footprints?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Footprints.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man\\'s or a woman\\'s?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice sank\\r\\nalmost to a whisper as he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 3. The Problem\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a thrill\\r\\nin the doctor\\'s voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by\\r\\nthat which he told us. Holmes leaned forward in his excitement and his\\r\\neyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot from them when he was keenly\\r\\ninterested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You saw this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As clearly as I see you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you said nothing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What was the use?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How was it that no one else saw it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave them\\r\\na thought. I don\\'t suppose I should have done so had I not known this\\r\\nlegend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are many sheep-dogs on the moor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No doubt, but this was no sheep-dog.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You say it was large?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Enormous.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it had not approached the body?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What sort of night was it?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Damp and raw.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But not actually raining?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the alley like?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve feet high and\\r\\nimpenetrable. The walk in the centre is about eight feet across.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is there anything between the hedges and the walk?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is there any other opening?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it from the\\r\\nhouse or else to enter it by the moor-gate?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is an exit through a summer-house at the far end.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had Sir Charles reached this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; he lay about fifty yards from it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, tell me, Dr. Mortimer--and this is important--the marks which you\\r\\nsaw were on the path and not on the grass?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No marks could show on the grass.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Were they on the same side of the path as the moor-gate?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the\\r\\nmoor-gate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You interest me exceedingly. Another point. Was the wicket-gate\\r\\nclosed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Closed and padlocked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How high was it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About four feet high.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then anyone could have got over it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None in particular.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heaven! Did no one examine?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I examined, myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And found nothing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was all very confused. Sir Charles had evidently stood there for\\r\\nfive or ten minutes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you know that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excellent! This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart. But the\\r\\nmarks?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. I could\\r\\ndiscern no others.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an impatient\\r\\ngesture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I had only been there!\" he cried. \"It is evidently a case of\\r\\nextraordinary interest, and one which presented immense opportunities to\\r\\nthe scientific expert. That gravel page upon which I might have read so\\r\\nmuch has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs\\r\\nof curious peasants. Oh, Dr. Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, to think that you\\r\\nshould not have called me in! You have indeed much to answer for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these facts to\\r\\nthe world, and I have already given my reasons for not wishing to do so.\\r\\nBesides, besides--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why do you hesitate?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of\\r\\ndetectives is helpless.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean that the thing is supernatural?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not positively say so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, but you evidently think it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come to my ears several\\r\\nincidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of Nature.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For example?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen\\r\\na creature upon the moor which corresponds with this Baskerville demon,\\r\\nand which could not possibly be any animal known to science. They all\\r\\nagreed that it was a huge creature, luminous, ghastly, and spectral. I\\r\\nhave cross-examined these men, one of them a hard-headed countryman,\\r\\none a farrier, and one a moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of\\r\\nthis dreadful apparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the\\r\\nlegend. I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district,\\r\\nand that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know what to believe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes shrugged his shoulders. \"I have hitherto confined my\\r\\ninvestigations to this world,\" said he. \"In a modest way I have combated\\r\\nevil, but to take on the Father of Evil himself would, perhaps, be too\\r\\nambitious a task. Yet you must admit that the footmark is material.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The original hound was material enough to tug a man\\'s throat out, and\\r\\nyet he was diabolical as well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But now,\\r\\nDr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why have you come\\r\\nto consult me at all? You tell me in the same breath that it is useless\\r\\nto investigate Sir Charles\\'s death, and that you desire me to do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not say that I desired you to do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, how can I assist you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville, who\\r\\narrives at Waterloo Station\"--Dr. Mortimer looked at his watch--\"in\\r\\nexactly one hour and a quarter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He being the heir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young gentleman\\r\\nand found that he had been farming in Canada. From the accounts which\\r\\nhave reached us he is an excellent fellow in every way. I speak now not\\r\\nas a medical man but as a trustee and executor of Sir Charles\\'s will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is no other claimant, I presume?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was Rodger\\r\\nBaskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir Charles was\\r\\nthe elder. The second brother, who died young, is the father of this lad\\r\\nHenry. The third, Rodger, was the black sheep of the family. He came of\\r\\nthe old masterful Baskerville strain and was the very image, they tell\\r\\nme, of the family picture of old Hugo. He made England too hot to hold\\r\\nhim, fled to Central America, and died there in 1876 of yellow fever.\\r\\nHenry is the last of the Baskervilles. In one hour and five minutes\\r\\nI meet him at Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that he arrived at\\r\\nSouthampton this morning. Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise me to\\r\\ndo with him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every Baskerville\\r\\nwho goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure that if Sir Charles\\r\\ncould have spoken with me before his death he would have warned me\\r\\nagainst bringing this, the last of the old race, and the heir to great\\r\\nwealth, to that deadly place. And yet it cannot be denied that the\\r\\nprosperity of the whole poor, bleak countryside depends upon his\\r\\npresence. All the good work which has been done by Sir Charles will\\r\\ncrash to the ground if there is no tenant of the Hall. I fear lest I\\r\\nshould be swayed too much by my own obvious interest in the matter, and\\r\\nthat is why I bring the case before you and ask for your advice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes considered for a little time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Put into plain words, the matter is this,\" said he. \"In your opinion\\r\\nthere is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for a\\r\\nBaskerville--that is your opinion?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence\\r\\nthat this may be so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it could\\r\\nwork the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire. A devil\\r\\nwith merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable\\r\\na thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would probably\\r\\ndo if you were brought into personal contact with these things. Your\\r\\nadvice, then, as I understand it, is that the young man will be as safe\\r\\nin Devonshire as in London. He comes in fifty minutes. What would you\\r\\nrecommend?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is\\r\\nscratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir Henry\\r\\nBaskerville.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up my\\r\\nmind about the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How long will it take you to make up your mind?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Twenty-four hours. At ten o\\'clock tomorrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will be\\r\\nmuch obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will be\\r\\nof help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir Henry\\r\\nBaskerville with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will do so, Mr. Holmes.\" He scribbled the appointment on his\\r\\nshirt-cuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded\\r\\nfashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir Charles\\r\\nBaskerville\\'s death several people saw this apparition upon the moor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Three people did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did any see it after?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not heard of any.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you. Good-morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction\\r\\nwhich meant that he had a congenial task before him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Going out, Watson?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unless I can help you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to you for\\r\\naid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points of view.\\r\\nWhen you pass Bradley\\'s, would you ask him to send up a pound of the\\r\\nstrongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as well if you could make\\r\\nit convenient not to return before evening. Then I should be very glad\\r\\nto compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has\\r\\nbeen submitted to us this morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend\\r\\nin those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed\\r\\nevery particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories, balanced\\r\\none against the other, and made up his mind as to which points were\\r\\nessential and which immaterial. I therefore spent the day at my club and\\r\\ndid not return to Baker Street until evening. It was nearly nine o\\'clock\\r\\nwhen I found myself in the sitting-room once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken out,\\r\\nfor the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon\\r\\nthe table was blurred by it. As I entered, however, my fears were set at\\r\\nrest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me\\r\\nby the throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I had a vague vision\\r\\nof Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black\\r\\nclay pipe between his lips. Several rolls of paper lay around him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Caught cold, Watson?\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, it\\'s this poisonous atmosphere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thick! It is intolerable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Open the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I perceive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Holmes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Am I right?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, but how?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed at my bewildered expression. \"There is a delightful freshness\\r\\nabout you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small\\r\\npowers which I possess at your expense. A gentleman goes forth on a\\r\\nshowery and miry day. He returns immaculate in the evening with the\\r\\ngloss still on his hat and his boots. He has been a fixture therefore\\r\\nall day. He is not a man with intimate friends. Where, then, could he\\r\\nhave been? Is it not obvious?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it is rather obvious.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever\\r\\nobserves. Where do you think that I have been?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A fixture also.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In spirit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly. My body has remained in this armchair and has, I regret\\r\\nto observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an\\r\\nincredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to Stamford\\'s\\r\\nfor the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my spirit has\\r\\nhovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I could find my way\\r\\nabout.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A large-scale map, I presume?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very large.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe unrolled one section and held it over his knee. \"Here you have the\\r\\nparticular district which concerns us. That is Baskerville Hall in the\\r\\nmiddle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With a wood round it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly. I fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that name, must\\r\\nstretch along this line, with the moor, as you perceive, upon the right\\r\\nof it. This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of Grimpen,\\r\\nwhere our friend Dr. Mortimer has his headquarters. Within a radius of\\r\\nfive miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered dwellings.\\r\\nHere is Lafter Hall, which was mentioned in the narrative. There is\\r\\na house indicated here which may be the residence of the\\r\\nnaturalist--Stapleton, if I remember right, was his name. Here are two\\r\\nmoorland farmhouses, High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles away the\\r\\ngreat convict prison of Princetown. Between and around these scattered\\r\\npoints extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is the stage\\r\\nupon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help to play\\r\\nit again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must be a wild place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to have a\\r\\nhand in the affairs of men--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The devil\\'s agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not? There are\\r\\ntwo questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is whether any crime\\r\\nhas been committed at all; the second is, what is the crime and how was\\r\\nit committed? Of course, if Dr. Mortimer\\'s surmise should be correct,\\r\\nand we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature,\\r\\nthere is an end of our investigation. But we are bound to exhaust all\\r\\nother hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I think we\\'ll shut\\r\\nthat window again, if you don\\'t mind. It is a singular thing, but I find\\r\\nthat a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought. I have\\r\\nnot pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think, but that is\\r\\nthe logical outcome of my convictions. Have you turned the case over in\\r\\nyour mind?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you make of it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very bewildering.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It has certainly a character of its own. There are points of\\r\\ndistinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example. What\\r\\ndo you make of that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of\\r\\nthe alley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why should a\\r\\nman walk on tiptoe down the alley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was running, Watson--running desperately, running for his life,\\r\\nrunning until he burst his heart--and fell dead upon his face.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Running from what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was crazed\\r\\nwith fear before ever he began to run.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you say that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor.\\r\\nIf that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had lost his\\r\\nwits would have run from the house instead of towards it. If the\\r\\ngipsy\\'s evidence may be taken as true, he ran with cries for help in the\\r\\ndirection where help was least likely to be. Then, again, whom was he\\r\\nwaiting for that night, and why was he waiting for him in the yew alley\\r\\nrather than in his own house?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You think that he was waiting for someone?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an evening\\r\\nstroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement. Is it natural\\r\\nthat he should stand for five or ten minutes, as Dr. Mortimer, with more\\r\\npractical sense than I should have given him credit for, deduced from\\r\\nthe cigar ash?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he went out every evening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every evening. On\\r\\nthe contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor. That night he\\r\\nwaited there. It was the night before he made his departure for London.\\r\\nThe thing takes shape, Watson. It becomes coherent. Might I ask you to\\r\\nhand me my violin, and we will postpone all further thought upon this\\r\\nbusiness until we have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir\\r\\nHenry Baskerville in the morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 4. Sir Henry Baskerville\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOur breakfast table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his\\r\\ndressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were punctual to\\r\\ntheir appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when Dr. Mortimer\\r\\nwas shown up, followed by the young baronet. The latter was a small,\\r\\nalert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very sturdily built,\\r\\nwith thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious face. He wore a\\r\\nruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten appearance of one who\\r\\nhas spent most of his time in the open air, and yet there was something\\r\\nin his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated\\r\\nthe gentleman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is Sir Henry Baskerville,\" said Dr. Mortimer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, yes,\" said he, \"and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\r\\nthat if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this morning\\r\\nI should have come on my own account. I understand that you think out\\r\\nlittle puzzles, and I\\'ve had one this morning which wants more thinking\\r\\nout than I am able to give it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you have\\r\\nyourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in London?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as not.\\r\\nIt was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me this\\r\\nmorning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It was of\\r\\ncommon quality, grayish in colour. The address, \"Sir Henry Baskerville,\\r\\nNorthumberland Hotel,\" was printed in rough characters; the post-mark\\r\\n\"Charing Cross,\" and the date of posting the preceding evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?\" asked\\r\\nHolmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I had been staying with a friend,\" said the doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements.\" Out\\r\\nof the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded into four.\\r\\nThis he opened and spread flat upon the table. Across the middle of it\\r\\na single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting printed\\r\\nwords upon it. It ran:\\r\\n\\r\\n        As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word \"moor\" only was printed in ink.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said Sir Henry Baskerville, \"perhaps you will tell me, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that takes\\r\\nso much interest in my affairs?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there is\\r\\nnothing supernatural about this, at any rate?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced\\r\\nthat the business is supernatural.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What business?\" asked Sir Henry sharply. \"It seems to me that all you\\r\\ngentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry. I\\r\\npromise you that,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"We will confine ourselves\\r\\nfor the present with your permission to this very interesting document,\\r\\nwhich must have been put together and posted yesterday evening. Have you\\r\\nyesterday\\'s Times, Watson?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is here in the corner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Might I trouble you for it--the inside page, please, with the leading\\r\\narticles?\" He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up and down the\\r\\ncolumns. \"Capital article this on free trade. Permit me to give you an\\r\\nextract from it.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \\'You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special\\r\\n     trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a\\r\\n     protective tariff, but it stands to reason that such\\r\\n     legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the\\r\\n     country, diminish the value of our imports, and lower the\\r\\n     general conditions of life in this island.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you think of that, Watson?\" cried Holmes in high glee, rubbing\\r\\nhis hands together with satisfaction. \"Don\\'t you think that is an\\r\\nadmirable sentiment?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional interest, and\\r\\nSir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know much about the tariff and things of that kind,\" said he,\\r\\n\"but it seems to me we\\'ve got a bit off the trail so far as that note is\\r\\nconcerned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail, Sir\\r\\nHenry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do, but I fear\\r\\nthat even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I confess that I see no connection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection that\\r\\nthe one is extracted out of the other. \\'You,\\' \\'your,\\' \\'your,\\' \\'life,\\'\\r\\n\\'reason,\\' \\'value,\\' \\'keep away,\\' \\'from the.\\' Don\\'t you see now whence\\r\\nthese words have been taken?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By thunder, you\\'re right! Well, if that isn\\'t smart!\" cried Sir Henry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that \\'keep\\r\\naway\\' and \\'from the\\' are cut out in one piece.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, now--so it is!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have imagined,\"\\r\\nsaid Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement. \"I could understand\\r\\nanyone saying that the words were from a newspaper; but that you should\\r\\nname which, and add that it came from the leading article, is really one\\r\\nof the most remarkable things which I have ever known. How did you do\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from that\\r\\nof an Esquimau?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Most certainly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious. The\\r\\nsupra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve, the--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally obvious.\\r\\nThere is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type\\r\\nof a Times article and the slovenly print of an evening half-penny paper\\r\\nas there could be between your negro and your Esquimau. The detection of\\r\\ntypes is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special\\r\\nexpert in crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I\\r\\nconfused the Leeds Mercury with the Western Morning News. But a Times\\r\\nleader is entirely distinctive, and these words could have been taken\\r\\nfrom nothing else. As it was done yesterday the strong probability was\\r\\nthat we should find the words in yesterday\\'s issue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,\" said Sir Henry\\r\\nBaskerville, \"someone cut out this message with a scissors--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nail-scissors,\" said Holmes. \"You can see that it was a very\\r\\nshort-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips over \\'keep\\r\\naway.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of\\r\\nshort-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gum,\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word \\'moor\\' should\\r\\nhave been written?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all simple\\r\\nand might be found in any issue, but \\'moor\\' would be less common.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything else in\\r\\nthis message, Mr. Holmes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been\\r\\ntaken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is printed in rough\\r\\ncharacters. But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in any hands\\r\\nbut those of the highly educated. We may take it, therefore, that\\r\\nthe letter was composed by an educated man who wished to pose as an\\r\\nuneducated one, and his effort to conceal his own writing suggests that\\r\\nthat writing might be known, or come to be known, by you. Again, you\\r\\nwill observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, but\\r\\nthat some are much higher than others. \\'Life,\\' for example is quite out\\r\\nof its proper place. That may point to carelessness or it may point to\\r\\nagitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter. On the whole I incline\\r\\nto the latter view, since the matter was evidently important, and it\\r\\nis unlikely that the composer of such a letter would be careless. If he\\r\\nwere in a hurry it opens up the interesting question why he should be\\r\\nin a hurry, since any letter posted up to early morning would reach\\r\\nSir Henry before he would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an\\r\\ninterruption--and from whom?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork,\" said Dr.\\r\\nMortimer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and choose\\r\\nthe most likely. It is the scientific use of the imagination, but we\\r\\nhave always some material basis on which to start our speculation. Now,\\r\\nyou would call it a guess, no doubt, but I am almost certain that this\\r\\naddress has been written in a hotel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How in the world can you say that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink\\r\\nhave given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered twice in a single\\r\\nword and has run dry three times in a short address, showing that there\\r\\nwas very little ink in the bottle. Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is\\r\\nseldom allowed to be in such a state, and the combination of the two\\r\\nmust be quite rare. But you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where\\r\\nit is rare to get anything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation\\r\\nin saying that could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels\\r\\naround Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated Times\\r\\nleader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent this\\r\\nsingular message. Halloa! Halloa! What\\'s this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words were\\r\\npasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing,\" said he, throwing it down. \"It is a blank half-sheet of\\r\\npaper, without even a water-mark upon it. I think we have drawn as much\\r\\nas we can from this curious letter; and now, Sir Henry, has anything\\r\\nelse of interest happened to you since you have been in London?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel,\" said our\\r\\nvisitor. \"Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are coming to that. You have nothing else to report to us before we\\r\\ngo into this matter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth\\r\\nreporting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Henry smiled. \"I don\\'t know much of British life yet, for I have\\r\\nspent nearly all my time in the States and in Canada. But I hope that to\\r\\nlose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over\\r\\nhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have lost one of your boots?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear sir,\" cried Dr. Mortimer, \"it is only mislaid. You will find\\r\\nit when you return to the hotel. What is the use of troubling Mr. Holmes\\r\\nwith trifles of this kind?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly,\" said Holmes, \"however foolish the incident may seem. You have\\r\\nlost one of your boots, you say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door last night,\\r\\nand there was only one in the morning. I could get no sense out of the\\r\\nchap who cleans them. The worst of it is that I only bought the pair\\r\\nlast night in the Strand, and I have never had them on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be cleaned?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why I put\\r\\nthem out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you went out\\r\\nat once and bought a pair of boots?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round with me.\\r\\nYou see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the part, and\\r\\nit may be that I have got a little careless in my ways out West. Among\\r\\nother things I bought these brown boots--gave six dollars for them--and\\r\\nhad one stolen before ever I had them on my feet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It seems a singularly useless thing to steal,\" said Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\n\"I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer\\'s belief that it will not be long\\r\\nbefore the missing boot is found.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And, now, gentlemen,\" said the baronet with decision, \"it seems to me\\r\\nthat I have spoken quite enough about the little that I know. It is time\\r\\nthat you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what we are all\\r\\ndriving at.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your request is a very reasonable one,\" Holmes answered. \"Dr. Mortimer,\\r\\nI think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it\\r\\nto us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his pocket\\r\\nand presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before.\\r\\nSir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest attention and with an\\r\\noccasional exclamation of surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance,\" said\\r\\nhe when the long narrative was finished. \"Of course, I\\'ve heard of the\\r\\nhound ever since I was in the nursery. It\\'s the pet story of the family,\\r\\nthough I never thought of taking it seriously before. But as to my\\r\\nuncle\\'s death--well, it all seems boiling up in my head, and I can\\'t\\r\\nget it clear yet. You don\\'t seem quite to have made up your mind whether\\r\\nit\\'s a case for a policeman or a clergyman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Precisely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now there\\'s this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. I suppose\\r\\nthat fits into its place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on\\r\\nupon the moor,\" said Dr. Mortimer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And also,\" said Holmes, \"that someone is not ill-disposed towards you,\\r\\nsince they warn you of danger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, of course, that is possible also. I am very much indebted to you,\\r\\nDr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which presents several\\r\\ninteresting alternatives. But the practical point which we now have to\\r\\ndecide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or is not advisable for you to go to\\r\\nBaskerville Hall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should I not go?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There seems to be danger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from\\r\\nhuman beings?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, that is what we have to find out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to\\r\\nthe home of my own people, and you may take that to be my final answer.\"\\r\\nHis dark brows knitted and his face flushed to a dusky red as he spoke.\\r\\nIt was evident that the fiery temper of the Baskervilles was not extinct\\r\\nin this their last representative. \"Meanwhile,\" said he, \"I have hardly\\r\\nhad time to think over all that you have told me. It\\'s a big thing for a\\r\\nman to have to understand and to decide at one sitting. I should like\\r\\nto have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind. Now, look here, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes, it\\'s half-past eleven now and I am going back right away to my\\r\\nhotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson, come round and lunch\\r\\nwith us at two. I\\'ll be able to tell you more clearly then how this\\r\\nthing strikes me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is that convenient to you, Watson?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perfectly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'d prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll join you in a walk, with pleasure,\" said his companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then we meet again at two o\\'clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the\\r\\nfront door. In an instant Holmes had changed from the languid dreamer to\\r\\nthe man of action.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment to lose!\" He rushed\\r\\ninto his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a few seconds\\r\\nin a frock-coat. We hurried together down the stairs and into the\\r\\nstreet. Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still visible about two\\r\\nhundred yards ahead of us in the direction of Oxford Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall I run on and stop them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not for the world, my dear Watson. I am perfectly satisfied with your\\r\\ncompany if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are wise, for it is\\r\\ncertainly a very fine morning for a walk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided\\r\\nus by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards behind, we\\r\\nfollowed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street. Once our friends\\r\\nstopped and stared into a shop window, upon which Holmes did the\\r\\nsame. An instant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfaction, and,\\r\\nfollowing the direction of his eager eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with\\r\\na man inside which had halted on the other side of the street was now\\r\\nproceeding slowly onward again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s our man, Watson! Come along! We\\'ll have a good look at him, if\\r\\nwe can do no more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of\\r\\npiercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.\\r\\nInstantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed to\\r\\nthe driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street. Holmes looked\\r\\neagerly round for another, but no empty one was in sight. Then he dashed\\r\\nin wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic, but the start was too\\r\\ngreat, and already the cab was out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There now!\" said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white with\\r\\nvexation from the tide of vehicles. \"Was ever such bad luck and such\\r\\nbad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are an honest man you will\\r\\nrecord this also and set it against my successes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who was the man?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not an idea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A spy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville has been\\r\\nvery closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town. How else\\r\\ncould it be known so quickly that it was the Northumberland Hotel which\\r\\nhe had chosen? If they had followed him the first day I argued that they\\r\\nwould follow him also the second. You may have observed that I twice\\r\\nstrolled over to the window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I remember.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none. We\\r\\nare dealing with a clever man, Watson. This matter cuts very deep, and\\r\\nthough I have not finally made up my mind whether it is a benevolent or\\r\\na malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I am conscious always of\\r\\npower and design. When our friends left I at once followed them in the\\r\\nhopes of marking down their invisible attendant. So wily was he that he\\r\\nhad not trusted himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab\\r\\nso that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their\\r\\nnotice. His method had the additional advantage that if they were to\\r\\ntake a cab he was all ready to follow them. It has, however, one obvious\\r\\ndisadvantage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It puts him in the power of the cabman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a pity we did not get the number!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not seriously\\r\\nimagine that I neglected to get the number? No. 2704 is our man. But\\r\\nthat is no use to us for the moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I fail to see how you could have done more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked in the\\r\\nother direction. I should then at my leisure have hired a second cab\\r\\nand followed the first at a respectful distance, or, better still, have\\r\\ndriven to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there. When our unknown\\r\\nhad followed Baskerville home we should have had the opportunity of\\r\\nplaying his own game upon himself and seeing where he made for. As\\r\\nit is, by an indiscreet eagerness, which was taken advantage of with\\r\\nextraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent, we have betrayed\\r\\nourselves and lost our man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this\\r\\nconversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long vanished in\\r\\nfront of us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is no object in our following them,\" said Holmes. \"The shadow has\\r\\ndeparted and will not return. We must see what further cards we have\\r\\nin our hands and play them with decision. Could you swear to that man\\'s\\r\\nface within the cab?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I could swear only to the beard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so could I--from which I gather that in all probability it was\\r\\na false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a\\r\\nbeard save to conceal his features. Come in here, Watson!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he was\\r\\nwarmly greeted by the manager.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in which I had\\r\\nthe good fortune to help you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhaps my\\r\\nlife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection, Wilson, that\\r\\nyou had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who showed some ability\\r\\nduring the investigation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, he is still with us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Could you ring him up?--thank you! And I should be glad to have change\\r\\nof this five-pound note.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the summons\\r\\nof the manager. He stood now gazing with great reverence at the famous\\r\\ndetective.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me have the Hotel Directory,\" said Holmes. \"Thank you! Now,\\r\\nCartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all in the\\r\\nimmediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do you see?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will visit each of these in turn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one shilling.\\r\\nHere are twenty-three shillings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of yesterday.\\r\\nYou will say that an important telegram has miscarried and that you are\\r\\nlooking for it. You understand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what you are really looking for is the centre page of the Times\\r\\nwith some holes cut in it with scissors. Here is a copy of the Times. It\\r\\nis this page. You could easily recognize it, could you not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter, to whom\\r\\nalso you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings. You will\\r\\nthen learn in possibly twenty cases out of the twenty-three that the\\r\\nwaste of the day before has been burned or removed. In the three other\\r\\ncases you will be shown a heap of paper and you will look for this page\\r\\nof the Times among it. The odds are enormously against your finding\\r\\nit. There are ten shillings over in case of emergencies. Let me have a\\r\\nreport by wire at Baker Street before evening. And now, Watson, it only\\r\\nremains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman, No. 2704,\\r\\nand then we will drop into one of the Bond Street picture galleries and\\r\\nfill in the time until we are due at the hotel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 5. Three Broken Threads\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of detaching\\r\\nhis mind at will. For two hours the strange business in which we had\\r\\nbeen involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was entirely absorbed in\\r\\nthe pictures of the modern Belgian masters. He would talk of nothing\\r\\nbut art, of which he had the crudest ideas, from our leaving the gallery\\r\\nuntil we found ourselves at the Northumberland Hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you,\" said the clerk. \"He\\r\\nasked me to show you up at once when you came.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any objection to my looking at your register?\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not in the least.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book showed that two names had been added after that of Baskerville.\\r\\nOne was Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle; the other Mrs.\\r\\nOldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know,\" said Holmes\\r\\nto the porter. \"A lawyer, is he not, gray-headed, and walks with a\\r\\nlimp?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir, this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active gentleman,\\r\\nnot older than yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surely you are mistaken about his trade?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir! he has used this hotel for many years, and he is very well\\r\\nknown to us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem to remember the name.\\r\\nExcuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friend one finds\\r\\nanother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was once mayor of Gloucester.\\r\\nShe always comes to us when she is in town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We have\\r\\nestablished a most important fact by these questions, Watson,\" he\\r\\ncontinued in a low voice as we went upstairs together. \"We know now that\\r\\nthe people who are so interested in our friend have not settled down\\r\\nin his own hotel. That means that while they are, as we have seen, very\\r\\nanxious to watch him, they are equally anxious that he should not see\\r\\nthem. Now, this is a most suggestive fact.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does it suggest?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It suggests--halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is the matter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir Henry\\r\\nBaskerville himself. His face was flushed with anger, and he held an old\\r\\nand dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious was he that he was hardly\\r\\narticulate, and when he did speak it was in a much broader and more\\r\\nWestern dialect than any which we had heard from him in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel,\" he cried.\\r\\n\"They\\'ll find they\\'ve started in to monkey with the wrong man unless\\r\\nthey are careful. By thunder, if that chap can\\'t find my missing boot\\r\\nthere will be trouble. I can take a joke with the best, Mr. Holmes, but\\r\\nthey\\'ve got a bit over the mark this time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Still looking for your boot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, and mean to find it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So it was, sir. And now it\\'s an old black one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! you don\\'t mean to say--?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s just what I do mean to say. I only had three pairs in the\\r\\nworld--the new brown, the old black, and the patent leathers, which I am\\r\\nwearing. Last night they took one of my brown ones, and today they have\\r\\nsneaked one of the black. Well, have you got it? Speak out, man, and\\r\\ndon\\'t stand staring!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAn agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear no word\\r\\nof it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, either that boot comes back before sundown or I\\'ll see the\\r\\nmanager and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It shall be found, sir--I promise you that if you will have a little\\r\\npatience it will be found.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mind it is, for it\\'s the last thing of mine that I\\'ll lose in this den\\r\\nof thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you\\'ll excuse my troubling you about\\r\\nsuch a trifle--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think it\\'s well worth troubling about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, you look very serious over it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you explain it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I just don\\'t attempt to explain it. It seems the very maddest, queerest\\r\\nthing that ever happened to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The queerest perhaps--\" said Holmes thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you make of it yourself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I don\\'t profess to understand it yet. This case of yours is very\\r\\ncomplex, Sir Henry. When taken in conjunction with your uncle\\'s death\\r\\nI am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of capital importance\\r\\nwhich I have handled there is one which cuts so deep. But we hold\\r\\nseveral threads in our hands, and the odds are that one or other of them\\r\\nguides us to the truth. We may waste time in following the wrong one,\\r\\nbut sooner or later we must come upon the right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the business\\r\\nwhich had brought us together. It was in the private sitting-room to\\r\\nwhich we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked Baskerville what were his\\r\\nintentions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To go to Baskerville Hall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And when?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the end of the week.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the whole,\" said Holmes, \"I think that your decision is a wise one.\\r\\nI have ample evidence that you are being dogged in London, and amid the\\r\\nmillions of this great city it is difficult to discover who these people\\r\\nare or what their object can be. If their intentions are evil they might\\r\\ndo you a mischief, and we should be powerless to prevent it. You did not\\r\\nknow, Dr. Mortimer, that you were followed this morning from my house?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Mortimer started violently. \"Followed! By whom?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. Have you among your\\r\\nneighbours or acquaintances on Dartmoor any man with a black, full\\r\\nbeard?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No--or, let me see--why, yes. Barrymore, Sir Charles\\'s butler, is a man\\r\\nwith a full, black beard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! Where is Barrymore?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is in charge of the Hall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We had best ascertain if he is really there, or if by any possibility\\r\\nhe might be in London.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you do that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Give me a telegraph form. \\'Is all ready for Sir Henry?\\' That will\\r\\ndo. Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What is the nearest\\r\\ntelegraph-office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send a second wire to the\\r\\npostmaster, Grimpen: \\'Telegram to Mr. Barrymore to be delivered into\\r\\nhis own hand. If absent, please return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville,\\r\\nNorthumberland Hotel.\\' That should let us know before evening whether\\r\\nBarrymore is at his post in Devonshire or not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s so,\" said Baskerville. \"By the way, Dr. Mortimer, who is this\\r\\nBarrymore, anyhow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. They have looked after\\r\\nthe Hall for four generations now. So far as I know, he and his wife are\\r\\nas respectable a couple as any in the county.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the same time,\" said Baskerville, \"it\\'s clear enough that so long as\\r\\nthere are none of the family at the Hall these people have a mighty fine\\r\\nhome and nothing to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is true.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles\\'s will?\" asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He and his wife had five hundred pounds each.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! Did they know that they would receive this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provisions of his\\r\\nwill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very interesting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope,\" said Dr. Mortimer, \"that you do not look with suspicious eyes\\r\\nupon everyone who received a legacy from Sir Charles, for I also had a\\r\\nthousand pounds left to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed! And anyone else?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There were many insignificant sums to individuals, and a large number\\r\\nof public charities. The residue all went to Sir Henry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how much was the residue?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes raised his eyebrows in surprise. \"I had no idea that so gigantic\\r\\na sum was involved,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not know how\\r\\nvery rich he was until we came to examine his securities. The total\\r\\nvalue of the estate was close on to a million.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me! It is a stake for which a man might well play a desperate\\r\\ngame. And one more question, Dr. Mortimer. Supposing that anything\\r\\nhappened to our young friend here--you will forgive the unpleasant\\r\\nhypothesis!--who would inherit the estate?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles\\'s younger brother died unmarried,\\r\\nthe estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are distant cousins. James\\r\\nDesmond is an elderly clergyman in Westmoreland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you. These details are all of great interest. Have you met Mr.\\r\\nJames Desmond?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles. He is a man of venerable\\r\\nappearance and of saintly life. I remember that he refused to accept any\\r\\nsettlement from Sir Charles, though he pressed it upon him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir Charles\\'s\\r\\nthousands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed. He would\\r\\nalso be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise by the\\r\\npresent owner, who can, of course, do what he likes with it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And have you made your will, Sir Henry?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I\\'ve had no time, for it was only yesterday\\r\\nthat I learned how matters stood. But in any case I feel that the money\\r\\nshould go with the title and estate. That was my poor uncle\\'s idea. How\\r\\nis the owner going to restore the glories of the Baskervilles if he has\\r\\nnot money enough to keep up the property? House, land, and dollars must\\r\\ngo together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to the\\r\\nadvisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay. There is\\r\\nonly one provision which I must make. You certainly must not go alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dr. Mortimer returns with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Dr. Mortimer has his practice to attend to, and his house is miles\\r\\naway from yours. With all the goodwill in the world he may be unable to\\r\\nhelp you. No, Sir Henry, you must take with you someone, a trusty man,\\r\\nwho will be always by your side.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it possible that you could come yourself, Mr. Holmes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If matters came to a crisis I should endeavour to be present in person;\\r\\nbut you can understand that, with my extensive consulting practice\\r\\nand with the constant appeals which reach me from many quarters, it is\\r\\nimpossible for me to be absent from London for an indefinite time. At\\r\\nthe present instant one of the most revered names in England is being\\r\\nbesmirched by a blackmailer, and only I can stop a disastrous scandal.\\r\\nYou will see how impossible it is for me to go to Dartmoor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whom would you recommend, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes laid his hand upon my arm. \"If my friend would undertake it there\\r\\nis no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a\\r\\ntight place. No one can say so more confidently than I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proposition took me completely by surprise, but before I had time to\\r\\nanswer, Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it heartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Watson,\" said he. \"You see how\\r\\nit is with me, and you know just as much about the matter as I do. If\\r\\nyou will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me through I\\'ll never\\r\\nforget it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and I was\\r\\ncomplimented by the words of Holmes and by the eagerness with which the\\r\\nbaronet hailed me as a companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will come, with pleasure,\" said I. \"I do not know how I could employ\\r\\nmy time better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you will report very carefully to me,\" said Holmes. \"When a crisis\\r\\ncomes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall act. I suppose that by\\r\\nSaturday all might be ready?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would that suit Dr. Watson?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perfectly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then on Saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet at the\\r\\nten-thirty train from Paddington.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry, of triumph, and\\r\\ndiving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot from\\r\\nunder a cabinet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My missing boot!\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May all our difficulties vanish as easily!\" said Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is a very singular thing,\" Dr. Mortimer remarked. \"I searched\\r\\nthis room carefully before lunch.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so did I,\" said Baskerville. \"Every inch of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was certainly no boot in it then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were\\r\\nlunching.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German was sent for but professed to know nothing of the matter,\\r\\nnor could any inquiry clear it up. Another item had been added to that\\r\\nconstant and apparently purposeless series of small mysteries which had\\r\\nsucceeded each other so rapidly. Setting aside the whole grim story of\\r\\nSir Charles\\'s death, we had a line of inexplicable incidents all within\\r\\nthe limits of two days, which included the receipt of the printed\\r\\nletter, the black-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss of the new brown\\r\\nboot, the loss of the old black boot, and now the return of the new\\r\\nbrown boot. Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to Baker\\r\\nStreet, and I knew from his drawn brows and keen face that his mind,\\r\\nlike my own, was busy in endeavouring to frame some scheme into which\\r\\nall these strange and apparently disconnected episodes could be fitted.\\r\\nAll afternoon and late into the evening he sat lost in tobacco and\\r\\nthought.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust before dinner two telegrams were handed in. The first ran:\\r\\n\\r\\nHave just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall. BASKERVILLE.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second:\\r\\n\\r\\nVisited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry, to report unable to\\r\\ntrace cut sheet of Times. CARTWRIGHT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There go two of my threads, Watson. There is nothing more stimulating\\r\\nthan a case where everything goes against you. We must cast round for\\r\\nanother scent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have still the cabman who drove the spy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly. I have wired to get his name and address from the Official\\r\\nRegistry. I should not be surprised if this were an answer to my\\r\\nquestion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ring at the bell proved to be something even more satisfactory\\r\\nthan an answer, however, for the door opened and a rough-looking fellow\\r\\nentered who was evidently the man himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I got a message from the head office that a gent at this address had\\r\\nbeen inquiring for No. 2704,\" said he. \"I\\'ve driven my cab this seven\\r\\nyears and never a word of complaint. I came here straight from the Yard\\r\\nto ask you to your face what you had against me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have nothing in the world against you, my good man,\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\"On the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a\\r\\nclear answer to my questions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'ve had a good day and no mistake,\" said the cabman with a grin.\\r\\n\"What was it you wanted to ask, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"First of all your name and address, in case I want you again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"John Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough. My cab is out of Shipley\\'s\\r\\nYard, near Waterloo Station.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes made a note of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who came and watched this\\r\\nhouse at ten o\\'clock this morning and afterwards followed the two\\r\\ngentlemen down Regent Street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man looked surprised and a little embarrassed. \"Why, there\\'s no good\\r\\nmy telling you things, for you seem to know as much as I do already,\"\\r\\nsaid he. \"The truth is that the gentleman told me that he was a\\r\\ndetective and that I was to say nothing about him to anyone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My good fellow; this is a very serious business, and you may find\\r\\nyourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me.\\r\\nYou say that your fare told you that he was a detective?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, he did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When did he say this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When he left me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did he say anything more?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He mentioned his name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me. \"Oh, he mentioned his name,\\r\\ndid he? That was imprudent. What was the name that he mentioned?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His name,\" said the cabman, \"was Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNever have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by the\\r\\ncabman\\'s reply. For an instant he sat in silent amazement. Then he burst\\r\\ninto a hearty laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A touch, Watson--an undeniable touch!\" said he. \"I feel a foil as quick\\r\\nand supple as my own. He got home upon me very prettily that time. So\\r\\nhis name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, that was the gentleman\\'s name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excellent! Tell me where you picked him up and all that occurred.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He hailed me at half-past nine in Trafalgar Square. He said that he was\\r\\na detective, and he offered me two guineas if I would do exactly what he\\r\\nwanted all day and ask no questions. I was glad enough to agree. First\\r\\nwe drove down to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there until two\\r\\ngentlemen came out and took a cab from the rank. We followed their cab\\r\\nuntil it pulled up somewhere near here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This very door,\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I couldn\\'t be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knew all about\\r\\nit. We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an hour and a half.\\r\\nThen the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and we followed down Baker\\r\\nStreet and along--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know,\" said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Until we got three-quarters down Regent Street. Then my gentleman threw\\r\\nup the trap, and he cried that I should drive right away to Waterloo\\r\\nStation as hard as I could go. I whipped up the mare and we were there\\r\\nunder the ten minutes. Then he paid up his two guineas, like a good one,\\r\\nand away he went into the station. Only just as he was leaving he turned\\r\\nround and he said: \\'It might interest you to know that you have been\\r\\ndriving Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\\' That\\'s how I come to know the name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see. And you saw no more of him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not after he went into the station.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cabman scratched his head. \"Well, he wasn\\'t altogether such an easy\\r\\ngentleman to describe. I\\'d put him at forty years of age, and he was\\r\\nof a middle height, two or three inches shorter than you, sir. He was\\r\\ndressed like a toff, and he had a black beard, cut square at the end,\\r\\nand a pale face. I don\\'t know as I could say more than that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colour of his eyes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I can\\'t say that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing more that you can remember?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir; nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, here is your half-sovereign. There\\'s another one waiting\\r\\nfor you if you can bring any more information. Good-night!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-night, sir, and thank you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me with a shrug of\\r\\nhis shoulders and a rueful smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,\" said he. \"The\\r\\ncunning rascal! He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry Baskerville had\\r\\nconsulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street, conjectured that I had\\r\\ngot the number of the cab and would lay my hands on the driver, and so\\r\\nsent back this audacious message. I tell you, Watson, this time we have\\r\\ngot a foeman who is worthy of our steel. I\\'ve been checkmated in London.\\r\\nI can only wish you better luck in Devonshire. But I\\'m not easy in my\\r\\nmind about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About sending you. It\\'s an ugly business, Watson, an ugly dangerous\\r\\nbusiness, and the more I see of it the less I like it. Yes, my dear\\r\\nfellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I shall be very glad\\r\\nto have you back safe and sound in Baker Street once more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 6. Baskerville Hall\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the appointed\\r\\nday, and we started as arranged for Devonshire. Mr. Sherlock Holmes\\r\\ndrove with me to the station and gave me his last parting injunctions\\r\\nand advice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions,\\r\\nWatson,\" said he; \"I wish you simply to report facts in the fullest\\r\\npossible manner to me, and you can leave me to do the theorizing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What sort of facts?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon the\\r\\ncase, and especially the relations between young Baskerville and his\\r\\nneighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death of Sir Charles.\\r\\nI have made some inquiries myself in the last few days, but the results\\r\\nhave, I fear, been negative. One thing only appears to be certain, and\\r\\nthat is that Mr. James Desmond, who is the next heir, is an elderly\\r\\ngentleman of a very amiable disposition, so that this persecution does\\r\\nnot arise from him. I really think that we may eliminate him entirely\\r\\nfrom our calculations. There remain the people who will actually\\r\\nsurround Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this Barrymore\\r\\ncouple?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By no means. You could not make a greater mistake. If they are innocent\\r\\nit would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty we should be\\r\\ngiving up all chance of bringing it home to them. No, no, we will\\r\\npreserve them upon our list of suspects. Then there is a groom at the\\r\\nHall, if I remember right. There are two moorland farmers. There is our\\r\\nfriend Dr. Mortimer, whom I believe to be entirely honest, and there is\\r\\nhis wife, of whom we know nothing. There is this naturalist, Stapleton,\\r\\nand there is his sister, who is said to be a young lady of attractions.\\r\\nThere is Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor,\\r\\nand there are one or two other neighbours. These are the folk who must\\r\\nbe your very special study.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will do my best.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have arms, I suppose?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I thought it as well to take them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Most certainly. Keep your revolver near you night and day, and never\\r\\nrelax your precautions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOur friends had already secured a first-class carriage and were waiting\\r\\nfor us upon the platform.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, we have no news of any kind,\" said Dr. Mortimer in answer to my\\r\\nfriend\\'s questions. \"I can swear to one thing, and that is that we\\r\\nhave not been shadowed during the last two days. We have never gone\\r\\nout without keeping a sharp watch, and no one could have escaped our\\r\\nnotice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have always kept together, I presume?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Except yesterday afternoon. I usually give up one day to pure amusement\\r\\nwhen I come to town, so I spent it at the Museum of the College of\\r\\nSurgeons.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I went to look at the folk in the park,\" said Baskerville.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But we had no trouble of any kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was imprudent, all the same,\" said Holmes, shaking his head and\\r\\nlooking very grave. \"I beg, Sir Henry, that you will not go about alone.\\r\\nSome great misfortune will befall you if you do. Did you get your other\\r\\nboot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir, it is gone forever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed. That is very interesting. Well, good-bye,\" he added as the\\r\\ntrain began to glide down the platform. \"Bear in mind, Sir Henry, one of\\r\\nthe phrases in that queer old legend which Dr. Mortimer has read to us,\\r\\nand avoid the moor in those hours of darkness when the powers of evil\\r\\nare exalted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind and saw the\\r\\ntall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless and gazing after us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I spent it in making the\\r\\nmore intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in playing with\\r\\nDr. Mortimer\\'s spaniel. In a very few hours the brown earth had\\r\\nbecome ruddy, the brick had changed to granite, and red cows grazed in\\r\\nwell-hedged fields where the lush grasses and more luxuriant vegetation\\r\\nspoke of a richer, if a damper, climate. Young Baskerville stared\\r\\neagerly out of the window and cried aloud with delight as he recognized\\r\\nthe familiar features of the Devon scenery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve been over a good part of the world since I left it, Dr. Watson,\"\\r\\nsaid he; \"but I have never seen a place to compare with it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his county,\" I\\r\\nremarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the county,\" said\\r\\nDr. Mortimer. \"A glance at our friend here reveals the rounded head of\\r\\nthe Celt, which carries inside it the Celtic enthusiasm and power\\r\\nof attachment. Poor Sir Charles\\'s head was of a very rare type, half\\r\\nGaelic, half Ivernian in its characteristics. But you were very young\\r\\nwhen you last saw Baskerville Hall, were you not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was a boy in my teens at the time of my father\\'s death and had never\\r\\nseen the Hall, for he lived in a little cottage on the South Coast.\\r\\nThence I went straight to a friend in America. I tell you it is all as\\r\\nnew to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I\\'m as keen as possible to see the\\r\\nmoor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you? Then your wish is easily granted, for there is your first\\r\\nsight of the moor,\" said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out of the carriage\\r\\nwindow.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there\\r\\nrose in the distance a gray, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged\\r\\nsummit, dim and vague in the distance, like some fantastic landscape in\\r\\na dream. Baskerville sat for a long time, his eyes fixed upon it, and I\\r\\nread upon his eager face how much it meant to him, this first sight of\\r\\nthat strange spot where the men of his blood had held sway so long\\r\\nand left their mark so deep. There he sat, with his tweed suit and his\\r\\nAmerican accent, in the corner of a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as\\r\\nI looked at his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how\\r\\ntrue a descendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery,\\r\\nand masterful men. There were pride, valour, and strength in his thick\\r\\nbrows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large hazel eyes. If on that\\r\\nforbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us,\\r\\nthis was at least a comrade for whom one might venture to take a risk\\r\\nwith the certainty that he would bravely share it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all descended.\\r\\nOutside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette with a pair of cobs\\r\\nwas waiting. Our coming was evidently a great event, for station-master\\r\\nand porters clustered round us to carry out our luggage. It was a sweet,\\r\\nsimple country spot, but I was surprised to observe that by the gate\\r\\nthere stood two soldierly men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their\\r\\nshort rifles and glanced keenly at us as we passed. The coachman, a\\r\\nhard-faced, gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in\\r\\na few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road. Rolling\\r\\npasture lands curved upward on either side of us, and old gabled houses\\r\\npeeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but behind the peaceful\\r\\nand sunlit countryside there rose ever, dark against the evening sky,\\r\\nthe long, gloomy curve of the moor, broken by the jagged and sinister\\r\\nhills.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upward through\\r\\ndeep lanes worn by centuries of wheels, high banks on either side, heavy\\r\\nwith dripping moss and fleshy hart\\'s-tongue ferns. Bronzing bracken and\\r\\nmottled bramble gleamed in the light of the sinking sun. Still steadily\\r\\nrising, we passed over a narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy\\r\\nstream which gushed swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the gray\\r\\nboulders. Both road and stream wound up through a valley dense with\\r\\nscrub oak and fir. At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation of\\r\\ndelight, looking eagerly about him and asking countless questions. To\\r\\nhis eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon\\r\\nthe countryside, which bore so clearly the mark of the waning year.\\r\\nYellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we\\r\\npassed. The rattle of our wheels died away as we drove through drifts of\\r\\nrotting vegetation--sad gifts, as it seemed to me, for Nature to throw\\r\\nbefore the carriage of the returning heir of the Baskervilles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Halloa!\" cried Dr. Mortimer, \"what is this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur of the moor, lay in\\r\\nfront of us. On the summit, hard and clear like an equestrian statue\\r\\nupon its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark and stern, his rifle\\r\\npoised ready over his forearm. He was watching the road along which we\\r\\ntravelled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is this, Perkins?\" asked Dr. Mortimer.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur driver half turned in his seat. \"There\\'s a convict escaped from\\r\\nPrincetown, sir. He\\'s been out three days now, and the warders watch\\r\\nevery road and every station, but they\\'ve had no sight of him yet. The\\r\\nfarmers about here don\\'t like it, sir, and that\\'s a fact.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I understand that they get five pounds if they can give\\r\\ninformation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing compared\\r\\nto the chance of having your throat cut. You see, it isn\\'t like any\\r\\nordinary convict. This is a man that would stick at nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is he, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is Selden, the Notting Hill murderer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI remembered the case well, for it was one in which Holmes had taken an\\r\\ninterest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the\\r\\nwanton brutality which had marked all the actions of the assassin. The\\r\\ncommutation of his death sentence had been due to some doubts as to his\\r\\ncomplete sanity, so atrocious was his conduct. Our wagonette had topped\\r\\na rise and in front of us rose the huge expanse of the moor, mottled\\r\\nwith gnarled and craggy cairns and tors. A cold wind swept down from\\r\\nit and set us shivering. Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was\\r\\nlurking this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, his\\r\\nheart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast him out.\\r\\nIt needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness of the barren\\r\\nwaste, the chilling wind, and the darkling sky. Even Baskerville fell\\r\\nsilent and pulled his overcoat more closely around him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had left the fertile country behind and beneath us. We looked back on\\r\\nit now, the slanting rays of a low sun turning the streams to threads of\\r\\ngold and glowing on the red earth new turned by the plough and the broad\\r\\ntangle of the woodlands. The road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder\\r\\nover huge russet and olive slopes, sprinkled with giant boulders. Now\\r\\nand then we passed a moorland cottage, walled and roofed with stone,\\r\\nwith no creeper to break its harsh outline. Suddenly we looked down into\\r\\na cuplike depression, patched with stunted oaks and firs which had been\\r\\ntwisted and bent by the fury of years of storm. Two high, narrow towers\\r\\nrose over the trees. The driver pointed with his whip.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Baskerville Hall,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and shining\\r\\neyes. A few minutes later we had reached the lodge-gates, a maze of\\r\\nfantastic tracery in wrought iron, with weather-bitten pillars on either\\r\\nside, blotched with lichens, and surmounted by the boars\\' heads of the\\r\\nBaskervilles. The lodge was a ruin of black granite and bared ribs of\\r\\nrafters, but facing it was a new building, half constructed, the first\\r\\nfruit of Sir Charles\\'s South African gold.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the gateway we passed into the avenue, where the wheels were\\r\\nagain hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot their branches in a\\r\\nsombre tunnel over our heads. Baskerville shuddered as he looked up\\r\\nthe long, dark drive to where the house glimmered like a ghost at the\\r\\nfarther end.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was it here?\" he asked in a low voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, the yew alley is on the other side.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young heir glanced round with a gloomy face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in such a\\r\\nplace as this,\" said he. \"It\\'s enough to scare any man. I\\'ll have a row\\r\\nof electric lamps up here inside of six months, and you won\\'t know it\\r\\nagain, with a thousand candle-power Swan and Edison right here in front\\r\\nof the hall door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf, and the house lay before\\r\\nus. In the fading light I could see that the centre was a heavy block\\r\\nof building from which a porch projected. The whole front was draped in\\r\\nivy, with a patch clipped bare here and there where a window or a coat\\r\\nof arms broke through the dark veil. From this central block rose the\\r\\ntwin towers, ancient, crenelated, and pierced with many loopholes. To\\r\\nright and left of the turrets were more modern wings of black granite.\\r\\nA dull light shone through heavy mullioned windows, and from the high\\r\\nchimneys which rose from the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a\\r\\nsingle black column of smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Welcome, Sir Henry! Welcome to Baskerville Hall!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the door of\\r\\nthe wagonette. The figure of a woman was silhouetted against the yellow\\r\\nlight of the hall. She came out and helped the man to hand down our\\r\\nbags.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry?\" said Dr. Mortimer.\\r\\n\"My wife is expecting me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surely you will stay and have some dinner?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I must go. I shall probably find some work awaiting me. I would\\r\\nstay to show you over the house, but Barrymore will be a better guide\\r\\nthan I. Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day to send for me if I\\r\\ncan be of service.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I turned\\r\\ninto the hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us. It was a fine\\r\\napartment in which we found ourselves, large, lofty, and heavily\\r\\nraftered with huge baulks of age-blackened oak. In the great\\r\\nold-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a log-fire crackled\\r\\nand snapped. Sir Henry and I held out our hands to it, for we were numb\\r\\nfrom our long drive. Then we gazed round us at the high, thin window\\r\\nof old stained glass, the oak panelling, the stags\\' heads, the coats\\r\\nof arms upon the walls, all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the\\r\\ncentral lamp.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s just as I imagined it,\" said Sir Henry. \"Is it not the very\\r\\npicture of an old family home? To think that this should be the same\\r\\nhall in which for five hundred years my people have lived. It strikes me\\r\\nsolemn to think of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed about\\r\\nhim. The light beat upon him where he stood, but long shadows trailed\\r\\ndown the walls and hung like a black canopy above him. Barrymore had\\r\\nreturned from taking our luggage to our rooms. He stood in front of\\r\\nus now with the subdued manner of a well-trained servant. He was a\\r\\nremarkable-looking man, tall, handsome, with a square black beard and\\r\\npale, distinguished features.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you wish dinner to be served at once, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it ready?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In a very few minutes, sir. You will find hot water in your rooms. My\\r\\nwife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, to stay with you until you have\\r\\nmade your fresh arrangements, but you will understand that under the new\\r\\nconditions this house will require a considerable staff.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What new conditions?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, and we\\r\\nwere able to look after his wants. You would, naturally, wish to have\\r\\nmore company, and so you will need changes in your household.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only when it is quite convenient to you, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But your family have been with us for several generations, have they\\r\\nnot? I should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an old family\\r\\nconnection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler\\'s white face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I feel that also, sir, and so does my wife. But to tell the truth, sir,\\r\\nwe were both very much attached to Sir Charles, and his death gave us\\r\\na shock and made these surroundings very painful to us. I fear that we\\r\\nshall never again be easy in our minds at Baskerville Hall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what do you intend to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no doubt, sir, that we shall succeed in establishing ourselves\\r\\nin some business. Sir Charles\\'s generosity has given us the means to do\\r\\nso. And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you to your rooms.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall,\\r\\napproached by a double stair. From this central point two long corridors\\r\\nextended the whole length of the building, from which all the bedrooms\\r\\nopened. My own was in the same wing as Baskerville\\'s and almost next\\r\\ndoor to it. These rooms appeared to be much more modern than the\\r\\ncentral part of the house, and the bright paper and numerous candles\\r\\ndid something to remove the sombre impression which our arrival had left\\r\\nupon my mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the dining-room which opened out of the hall was a place of shadow\\r\\nand gloom. It was a long chamber with a step separating the dais where\\r\\nthe family sat from the lower portion reserved for their dependents.\\r\\nAt one end a minstrel\\'s gallery overlooked it. Black beams shot across\\r\\nabove our heads, with a smoke-darkened ceiling beyond them. With rows of\\r\\nflaring torches to light it up, and the colour and rude hilarity of\\r\\nan old-time banquet, it might have softened; but now, when two\\r\\nblack-clothed gentlemen sat in the little circle of light thrown by a\\r\\nshaded lamp, one\\'s voice became hushed and one\\'s spirit subdued. A\\r\\ndim line of ancestors, in every variety of dress, from the Elizabethan\\r\\nknight to the buck of the Regency, stared down upon us and daunted us by\\r\\ntheir silent company. We talked little, and I for one was glad when the\\r\\nmeal was over and we were able to retire into the modern billiard-room\\r\\nand smoke a cigarette.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My word, it isn\\'t a very cheerful place,\" said Sir Henry. \"I suppose\\r\\none can tone down to it, but I feel a bit out of the picture at present.\\r\\nI don\\'t wonder that my uncle got a little jumpy if he lived all alone\\r\\nin such a house as this. However, if it suits you, we will retire early\\r\\ntonight, and perhaps things may seem more cheerful in the morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI drew aside my curtains before I went to bed and looked out from my\\r\\nwindow. It opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall\\r\\ndoor. Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and swung in a rising wind. A\\r\\nhalf moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds. In its cold light I\\r\\nsaw beyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks, and the long, low curve\\r\\nof the melancholy moor. I closed the curtain, feeling that my last\\r\\nimpression was in keeping with the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet it was not quite the last. I found myself weary and yet wakeful,\\r\\ntossing restlessly from side to side, seeking for the sleep which would\\r\\nnot come. Far away a chiming clock struck out the quarters of the\\r\\nhours, but otherwise a deathly silence lay upon the old house. And then\\r\\nsuddenly, in the very dead of the night, there came a sound to my\\r\\nears, clear, resonant, and unmistakable. It was the sob of a woman, the\\r\\nmuffled, strangling gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow.\\r\\nI sat up in bed and listened intently. The noise could not have been\\r\\nfar away and was certainly in the house. For half an hour I waited with\\r\\nevery nerve on the alert, but there came no other sound save the chiming\\r\\nclock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 7. The Stapletons of Merripit House\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from\\r\\nour minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of\\r\\nus by our first experience of Baskerville Hall. As Sir Henry and I sat\\r\\nat breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows,\\r\\nthrowing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered\\r\\nthem. The dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it\\r\\nwas hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck\\r\\nsuch a gloom into our souls upon the evening before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to blame!\" said\\r\\nthe baronet. \"We were tired with our journey and chilled by our drive,\\r\\nso we took a gray view of the place. Now we are fresh and well, so it is\\r\\nall cheerful once more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet it was not entirely a question of imagination,\" I answered.\\r\\n\"Did you, for example, happen to hear someone, a woman I think, sobbing\\r\\nin the night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is curious, for I did when I was half asleep fancy that I heard\\r\\nsomething of the sort. I waited quite a time, but there was no more of\\r\\nit, so I concluded that it was all a dream.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob of a\\r\\nwoman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must ask about this right away.\" He rang the bell and asked\\r\\nBarrymore whether he could account for our experience. It seemed to me\\r\\nthat the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler still as he\\r\\nlistened to his master\\'s question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are only two women in the house, Sir Henry,\" he answered. \"One is\\r\\nthe scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing. The other is my wife,\\r\\nand I can answer for it that the sound could not have come from her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet he lied as he said it, for it chanced that after breakfast I met\\r\\nMrs. Barrymore in the long corridor with the sun full upon her face. She\\r\\nwas a large, impassive, heavy-featured woman with a stern set expression\\r\\nof mouth. But her telltale eyes were red and glanced at me from between\\r\\nswollen lids. It was she, then, who wept in the night, and if she did so\\r\\nher husband must know it. Yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery\\r\\nin declaring that it was not so. Why had he done this? And why did she\\r\\nweep so bitterly? Already round this pale-faced, handsome, black-bearded\\r\\nman there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery and of gloom. It was he\\r\\nwho had been the first to discover the body of Sir Charles, and we had\\r\\nonly his word for all the circumstances which led up to the old man\\'s\\r\\ndeath. Was it possible that it was Barrymore, after all, whom we had\\r\\nseen in the cab in Regent Street? The beard might well have been the\\r\\nsame. The cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but such an\\r\\nimpression might easily have been erroneous. How could I settle the\\r\\npoint forever? Obviously the first thing to do was to see the Grimpen\\r\\npostmaster and find whether the test telegram had really been placed in\\r\\nBarrymore\\'s own hands. Be the answer what it might, I should at least\\r\\nhave something to report to Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so that the\\r\\ntime was propitious for my excursion. It was a pleasant walk of four\\r\\nmiles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a small gray\\r\\nhamlet, in which two larger buildings, which proved to be the inn and\\r\\nthe house of Dr. Mortimer, stood high above the rest. The postmaster,\\r\\nwho was also the village grocer, had a clear recollection of the\\r\\ntelegram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, sir,\" said he, \"I had the telegram delivered to Mr.\\r\\nBarrymore exactly as directed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who delivered it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My boy here. James, you delivered that telegram to Mr. Barrymore at the\\r\\nHall last week, did you not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, father, I delivered it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Into his own hands?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, he was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not put it\\r\\ninto his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore\\'s hands, and she\\r\\npromised to deliver it at once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you see Mr. Barrymore?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir; I tell you he was in the loft.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you didn\\'t see him, how do you know he was in the loft?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, surely his own wife ought to know where he is,\" said the\\r\\npostmaster testily. \"Didn\\'t he get the telegram? If there is any mistake\\r\\nit is for Mr. Barrymore himself to complain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was clear\\r\\nthat in spite of Holmes\\'s ruse we had no proof that Barrymore had not\\r\\nbeen in London all the time. Suppose that it were so--suppose that the\\r\\nsame man had been the last who had seen Sir Charles alive, and the first\\r\\nto dog the new heir when he returned to England. What then? Was he the\\r\\nagent of others or had he some sinister design of his own? What interest\\r\\ncould he have in persecuting the Baskerville family? I thought of the\\r\\nstrange warning clipped out of the leading article of the Times. Was\\r\\nthat his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon\\r\\ncounteracting his schemes? The only conceivable motive was that which\\r\\nhad been suggested by Sir Henry, that if the family could be scared away\\r\\na comfortable and permanent home would be secured for the Barrymores.\\r\\nBut surely such an explanation as that would be quite inadequate to\\r\\naccount for the deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an\\r\\ninvisible net round the young baronet. Holmes himself had said that\\r\\nno more complex case had come to him in all the long series of his\\r\\nsensational investigations. I prayed, as I walked back along the gray,\\r\\nlonely road, that my friend might soon be freed from his preoccupations\\r\\nand able to come down to take this heavy burden of responsibility from\\r\\nmy shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running feet\\r\\nbehind me and by a voice which called me by name. I turned, expecting to\\r\\nsee Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a stranger who was pursuing\\r\\nme. He was a small, slim, clean-shaven, prim-faced man, flaxen-haired\\r\\nand leanjawed, between thirty and forty years of age, dressed in a gray\\r\\nsuit and wearing a straw hat. A tin box for botanical specimens hung\\r\\nover his shoulder and he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his\\r\\nhands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson,\" said he as he\\r\\ncame panting up to where I stood. \"Here on the moor we are homely folk\\r\\nand do not wait for formal introductions. You may possibly have heard\\r\\nmy name from our mutual friend, Mortimer. I am Stapleton, of Merripit\\r\\nHouse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your net and box would have told me as much,\" said I, \"for I knew that\\r\\nMr. Stapleton was a naturalist. But how did you know me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been calling on Mortimer, and he pointed you out to me from\\r\\nthe window of his surgery as you passed. As our road lay the same way I\\r\\nthought that I would overtake you and introduce myself. I trust that Sir\\r\\nHenry is none the worse for his journey?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is very well, thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We were all rather afraid that after the sad death of Sir Charles the\\r\\nnew baronet might refuse to live here. It is asking much of a wealthy\\r\\nman to come down and bury himself in a place of this kind, but I need\\r\\nnot tell you that it means a very great deal to the countryside. Sir\\r\\nHenry has, I suppose, no superstitious fears in the matter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not think that it is likely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the\\r\\nfamily?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here! Any\\r\\nnumber of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a creature\\r\\nupon the moor.\" He spoke with a smile, but I seemed to read in his eyes\\r\\nthat he took the matter more seriously. \"The story took a great hold\\r\\nupon the imagination of Sir Charles, and I have no doubt that it led to\\r\\nhis tragic end.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog might have\\r\\nhad a fatal effect upon his diseased heart. I fancy that he really\\r\\ndid see something of the kind upon that last night in the yew alley. I\\r\\nfeared that some disaster might occur, for I was very fond of the old\\r\\nman, and I knew that his heart was weak.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How did you know that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My friend Mortimer told me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You think, then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that he died of\\r\\nfright in consequence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any better explanation?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not come to any conclusion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the placid\\r\\nface and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no surprise was\\r\\nintended.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr. Watson,\"\\r\\nsaid he. \"The records of your detective have reached us here, and you\\r\\ncould not celebrate him without being known yourself. When Mortimer told\\r\\nme your name he could not deny your identity. If you are here, then it\\r\\nfollows that Mr. Sherlock Holmes is interesting himself in the matter,\\r\\nand I am naturally curious to know what view he may take.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid that I cannot answer that question.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He cannot leave town at present. He has other cases which engage his\\r\\nattention.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a pity! He might throw some light on that which is so dark to us.\\r\\nBut as to your own researches, if there is any possible way in which I\\r\\ncan be of service to you I trust that you will command me. If I had\\r\\nany indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to\\r\\ninvestigate the case, I might perhaps even now give you some aid or\\r\\nadvice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend, Sir\\r\\nHenry, and that I need no help of any kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excellent!\" said Stapleton. \"You are perfectly right to be wary and\\r\\ndiscreet. I am justly reproved for what I feel was an unjustifiable\\r\\nintrusion, and I promise you that I will not mention the matter again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the\\r\\nroad and wound away across the moor. A steep, boulder-sprinkled hill lay\\r\\nupon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry.\\r\\nThe face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and\\r\\nbrambles growing in its niches. From over a distant rise there floated a\\r\\ngray plume of smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit House,\"\\r\\nsaid he. \"Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may have the pleasure of\\r\\nintroducing you to my sister.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy first thought was that I should be by Sir Henry\\'s side. But then I\\r\\nremembered the pile of papers and bills with which his study table was\\r\\nlittered. It was certain that I could not help with those. And Holmes\\r\\nhad expressly said that I should study the neighbours upon the moor. I\\r\\naccepted Stapleton\\'s invitation, and we turned together down the path.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a wonderful place, the moor,\" said he, looking round over the\\r\\nundulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged granite\\r\\nfoaming up into fantastic surges. \"You never tire of the moor. You\\r\\ncannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains. It is so vast, and\\r\\nso barren, and so mysterious.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know it well, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have only been here two years. The residents would call me a\\r\\nnewcomer. We came shortly after Sir Charles settled. But my tastes led\\r\\nme to explore every part of the country round, and I should think that\\r\\nthere are few men who know it better than I do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it hard to know?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very hard. You see, for example, this great plain to the north here\\r\\nwith the queer hills breaking out of it. Do you observe anything\\r\\nremarkable about that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would be a rare place for a gallop.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You would naturally think so and the thought has cost several their\\r\\nlives before now. You notice those bright green spots scattered thickly\\r\\nover it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, they seem more fertile than the rest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStapleton laughed. \"That is the great Grimpen Mire,\" said he. \"A false\\r\\nstep yonder means death to man or beast. Only yesterday I saw one of the\\r\\nmoor ponies wander into it. He never came out. I saw his head for quite\\r\\na long time craning out of the bog-hole, but it sucked him down at last.\\r\\nEven in dry seasons it is a danger to cross it, but after these autumn\\r\\nrains it is an awful place. And yet I can find my way to the very heart\\r\\nof it and return alive. By George, there is another of those miserable\\r\\nponies!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges. Then a\\r\\nlong, agonized, writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful cry echoed\\r\\nover the moor. It turned me cold with horror, but my companion\\'s nerves\\r\\nseemed to be stronger than mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s gone!\" said he. \"The mire has him. Two in two days, and many more,\\r\\nperhaps, for they get in the way of going there in the dry weather and\\r\\nnever know the difference until the mire has them in its clutches. It\\'s\\r\\na bad place, the great Grimpen Mire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you say you can penetrate it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, there are one or two paths which a very active man can take. I\\r\\nhave found them out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why should you wish to go into so horrible a place?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you see the hills beyond? They are really islands cut off on all\\r\\nsides by the impassable mire, which has crawled round them in the course\\r\\nof years. That is where the rare plants and the butterflies are, if you\\r\\nhave the wit to reach them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall try my luck some day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at me with a surprised face. \"For God\\'s sake put such an idea\\r\\nout of your mind,\" said he. \"Your blood would be upon my head. I assure\\r\\nyou that there would not be the least chance of your coming back alive.\\r\\nIt is only by remembering certain complex landmarks that I am able to do\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Halloa!\" I cried. \"What is that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept over the moor. It filled the\\r\\nwhole air, and yet it was impossible to say whence it came. From a\\r\\ndull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then sank back into a\\r\\nmelancholy, throbbing murmur once again. Stapleton looked at me with a\\r\\ncurious expression in his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Queer place, the moor!\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling for its\\r\\nprey. I\\'ve heard it once or twice before, but never quite so loud.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge swelling\\r\\nplain, mottled with the green patches of rushes. Nothing stirred over\\r\\nthe vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which croaked loudly from a tor\\r\\nbehind us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are an educated man. You don\\'t believe such nonsense as that?\" said\\r\\nI. \"What do you think is the cause of so strange a sound?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bogs make queer noises sometimes. It\\'s the mud settling, or the water\\r\\nrising, or something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, that was a living voice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, perhaps it was. Did you ever hear a bittern booming?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I never did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a very rare bird--practically extinct--in England now, but all\\r\\nthings are possible upon the moor. Yes, I should not be surprised to\\r\\nlearn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of the bitterns.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard in my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it\\'s rather an uncanny place altogether. Look at the hillside\\r\\nyonder. What do you make of those?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole steep slope was covered with gray circular rings of stone, a\\r\\nscore of them at least.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are they? Sheep-pens?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, they are the homes of our worthy ancestors. Prehistoric man lived\\r\\nthickly on the moor, and as no one in particular has lived there since,\\r\\nwe find all his little arrangements exactly as he left them. These are\\r\\nhis wigwams with the roofs off. You can even see his hearth and his\\r\\ncouch if you have the curiosity to go inside.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is quite a town. When was it inhabited?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neolithic man--no date.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did he do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig for tin\\r\\nwhen the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. Look at the\\r\\ngreat trench in the opposite hill. That is his mark. Yes, you will find\\r\\nsome very singular points about the moor, Dr. Watson. Oh, excuse me an\\r\\ninstant! It is surely Cyclopides.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an instant\\r\\nStapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of\\r\\nit. To my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire, and my\\r\\nacquaintance never paused for an instant, bounding from tuft to tuft\\r\\nbehind it, his green net waving in the air. His gray clothes and jerky,\\r\\nzigzag, irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself.\\r\\nI was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his\\r\\nextraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the\\r\\ntreacherous mire, when I heard the sound of steps and, turning round,\\r\\nfound a woman near me upon the path. She had come from the direction in\\r\\nwhich the plume of smoke indicated the position of Merripit House, but\\r\\nthe dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had\\r\\nbeen told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor, and I\\r\\nremembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a beauty. The\\r\\nwoman who approached me was certainly that, and of a most uncommon type.\\r\\nThere could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister,\\r\\nfor Stapleton was neutral tinted, with light hair and gray eyes, while\\r\\nshe was darker than any brunette whom I have seen in England--slim,\\r\\nelegant, and tall. She had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it\\r\\nmight have seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the\\r\\nbeautiful dark, eager eyes. With her perfect figure and elegant dress\\r\\nshe was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path. Her\\r\\neyes were on her brother as I turned, and then she quickened her pace\\r\\ntowards me. I had raised my hat and was about to make some explanatory\\r\\nremark when her own words turned all my thoughts into a new channel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go back!\" she said. \"Go straight back to London, instantly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI could only stare at her in stupid surprise. Her eyes blazed at me, and\\r\\nshe tapped the ground impatiently with her foot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should I go back?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot explain.\" She spoke in a low, eager voice, with a curious lisp\\r\\nin her utterance. \"But for God\\'s sake do what I ask you. Go back and\\r\\nnever set foot upon the moor again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I have only just come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Man, man!\" she cried. \"Can you not tell when a warning is for your own\\r\\ngood? Go back to London! Start tonight! Get away from this place at all\\r\\ncosts! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a word of what I have said. Would\\r\\nyou mind getting that orchid for me among the mare\\'s-tails yonder? We\\r\\nare very rich in orchids on the moor, though, of course, you are rather\\r\\nlate to see the beauties of the place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard and\\r\\nflushed with his exertions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Halloa, Beryl!\" said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of his\\r\\ngreeting was not altogether a cordial one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Jack, you are very hot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldom found in\\r\\nthe late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed him!\" He spoke\\r\\nunconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced incessantly from the\\r\\ngirl to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have introduced yourselves, I can see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to see the\\r\\ntrue beauties of the moor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, who do you think this is?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" said I. \"Only a humble commoner, but his friend. My name is\\r\\nDr. Watson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. \"We have been\\r\\ntalking at cross purposes,\" said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, you had not very much time for talk,\" her brother remarked with\\r\\nthe same questioning eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being merely a\\r\\nvisitor,\" said she. \"It cannot much matter to him whether it is early\\r\\nor late for the orchids. But you will come on, will you not, and see\\r\\nMerripit House?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the farm\\r\\nof some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into repair and\\r\\nturned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded it, but the trees,\\r\\nas is usual upon the moor, were stunted and nipped, and the effect of\\r\\nthe whole place was mean and melancholy. We were admitted by a strange,\\r\\nwizened, rusty-coated old manservant, who seemed in keeping with\\r\\nthe house. Inside, however, there were large rooms furnished with an\\r\\nelegance in which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady. As I\\r\\nlooked from their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moor\\r\\nrolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but marvel at what\\r\\ncould have brought this highly educated man and this beautiful woman to\\r\\nlive in such a place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Queer spot to choose, is it not?\" said he as if in answer to my\\r\\nthought. \"And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we not,\\r\\nBeryl?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite happy,\" said she, but there was no ring of conviction in her\\r\\nwords.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had a school,\" said Stapleton. \"It was in the north country. The work\\r\\nto a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting, but the\\r\\nprivilege of living with youth, of helping to mould those young minds,\\r\\nand of impressing them with one\\'s own character and ideals was very dear\\r\\nto me. However, the fates were against us. A serious epidemic broke out\\r\\nin the school and three of the boys died. It never recovered from the\\r\\nblow, and much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up. And yet,\\r\\nif it were not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys,\\r\\nI could rejoice over my own misfortune, for, with my strong tastes\\r\\nfor botany and zoology, I find an unlimited field of work here, and my\\r\\nsister is as devoted to Nature as I am. All this, Dr. Watson, has been\\r\\nbrought upon your head by your expression as you surveyed the moor out\\r\\nof our window.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull--less for\\r\\nyou, perhaps, than for your sister.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, I am never dull,\" said she quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting neighbours.\\r\\nDr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his own line. Poor Sir Charles was\\r\\nalso an admirable companion. We knew him well and miss him more than\\r\\nI can tell. Do you think that I should intrude if I were to call this\\r\\nafternoon and make the acquaintance of Sir Henry?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure that he would be delighted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so. We may in\\r\\nour humble way do something to make things more easy for him until he\\r\\nbecomes accustomed to his new surroundings. Will you come upstairs, Dr.\\r\\nWatson, and inspect my collection of Lepidoptera? I think it is the most\\r\\ncomplete one in the south-west of England. By the time that you have\\r\\nlooked through them lunch will be almost ready.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of the moor,\\r\\nthe death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which had been\\r\\nassociated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all these things\\r\\ntinged my thoughts with sadness. Then on the top of these more or less\\r\\nvague impressions there had come the definite and distinct warning of\\r\\nMiss Stapleton, delivered with such intense earnestness that I could\\r\\nnot doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it. I resisted\\r\\nall pressure to stay for lunch, and I set off at once upon my return\\r\\njourney, taking the grass-grown path by which we had come.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for those\\r\\nwho knew it, for before I had reached the road I was astounded to see\\r\\nMiss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the track. Her face\\r\\nwas beautifully flushed with her exertions and she held her hand to her\\r\\nside.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson,\" said she.\\r\\n\"I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop, or my brother\\r\\nmay miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am about the stupid\\r\\nmistake I made in thinking that you were Sir Henry. Please forget the\\r\\nwords I said, which have no application whatever to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I can\\'t forget them, Miss Stapleton,\" said I. \"I am Sir Henry\\'s\\r\\nfriend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine. Tell me why it\\r\\nwas that you were so eager that Sir Henry should return to London.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A woman\\'s whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better you will understand\\r\\nthat I cannot always give reasons for what I say or do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no. I remember the thrill in your voice. I remember the look in\\r\\nyour eyes. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton, for ever\\r\\nsince I have been here I have been conscious of shadows all round me.\\r\\nLife has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with little green patches\\r\\neverywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track.\\r\\nTell me then what it was that you meant, and I will promise to convey\\r\\nyour warning to Sir Henry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAn expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her face, but\\r\\nher eyes had hardened again when she answered me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You make too much of it, Dr. Watson,\" said she. \"My brother and I\\r\\nwere very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles. We knew him very\\r\\nintimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house. He\\r\\nwas deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the family, and when\\r\\nthis tragedy came I naturally felt that there must be some grounds\\r\\nfor the fears which he had expressed. I was distressed therefore when\\r\\nanother member of the family came down to live here, and I felt that he\\r\\nshould be warned of the danger which he will run. That was all which I\\r\\nintended to convey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what is the danger?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know the story of the hound?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe in such nonsense.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I do. If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him away from\\r\\na place which has always been fatal to his family. The world is wide.\\r\\nWhy should he wish to live at the place of danger?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because it is the place of danger. That is Sir Henry\\'s nature. I fear\\r\\nthat unless you can give me some more definite information than this it\\r\\nwould be impossible to get him to move.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything definite.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant no\\r\\nmore than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not wish your\\r\\nbrother to overhear what you said? There is nothing to which he, or\\r\\nanyone else, could object.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he thinks it\\r\\nis for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. He would be very angry\\r\\nif he knew that I have said anything which might induce Sir Henry to\\r\\ngo away. But I have done my duty now and I will say no more. I must go\\r\\nback, or he will miss me and suspect that I have seen you. Good-bye!\"\\r\\nShe turned and had disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered\\r\\nboulders, while I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to\\r\\nBaskerville Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 8. First Report of Dr. Watson\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this point onward I will follow the course of events by\\r\\ntranscribing my own letters to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie before me\\r\\non the table. One page is missing, but otherwise they are exactly\\r\\nas written and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more\\r\\naccurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these tragic events, can\\r\\npossibly do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBaskerville Hall, October 13th. MY DEAR HOLMES: My previous letters\\r\\nand telegrams have kept you pretty well up to date as to all that has\\r\\noccurred in this most God-forsaken corner of the world. The longer one\\r\\nstays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one\\'s soul,\\r\\nits vastness, and also its grim charm. When you are once out upon its\\r\\nbosom you have left all traces of modern England behind you, but, on the\\r\\nother hand, you are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of\\r\\nthe prehistoric people. On all sides of you as you walk are the houses\\r\\nof these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge monoliths which\\r\\nare supposed to have marked their temples. As you look at their gray\\r\\nstone huts against the scarred hillsides you leave your own age behind\\r\\nyou, and if you were to see a skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the\\r\\nlow door fitting a flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you\\r\\nwould feel that his presence there was more natural than your own. The\\r\\nstrange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what must\\r\\nalways have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian, but I could\\r\\nimagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were forced\\r\\nto accept that which none other would occupy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent me and\\r\\nwill probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind.\\r\\nI can still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun\\r\\nmoved round the earth or the earth round the sun. Let me, therefore,\\r\\nreturn to the facts concerning Sir Henry Baskerville.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have not had any report within the last few days it is because\\r\\nup to today there was nothing of importance to relate. Then a very\\r\\nsurprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tell you in due course.\\r\\nBut, first of all, I must keep you in touch with some of the other\\r\\nfactors in the situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped\\r\\nconvict upon the moor. There is strong reason now to believe that he\\r\\nhas got right away, which is a considerable relief to the lonely\\r\\nhouseholders of this district. A fortnight has passed since his flight,\\r\\nduring which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard of him. It\\r\\nis surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during\\r\\nall that time. Of course, so far as his concealment goes there is\\r\\nno difficulty at all. Any one of these stone huts would give him a\\r\\nhiding-place. But there is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and\\r\\nslaughter one of the moor sheep. We think, therefore, that he has gone,\\r\\nand the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could take\\r\\ngood care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy moments\\r\\nwhen I have thought of the Stapletons. They live miles from any help.\\r\\nThere are one maid, an old manservant, the sister, and the brother, the\\r\\nlatter not a very strong man. They would be helpless in the hands of a\\r\\ndesperate fellow like this Notting Hill criminal if he could once effect\\r\\nan entrance. Both Sir Henry and I were concerned at their situation, and\\r\\nit was suggested that Perkins the groom should go over to sleep there,\\r\\nbut Stapleton would not hear of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display a\\r\\nconsiderable interest in our fair neighbour. It is not to be wondered\\r\\nat, for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like\\r\\nhim, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman. There is\\r\\nsomething tropical and exotic about her which forms a singular contrast\\r\\nto her cool and unemotional brother. Yet he also gives the idea of\\r\\nhidden fires. He has certainly a very marked influence over her, for\\r\\nI have seen her continually glance at him as she talked as if seeking\\r\\napprobation for what she said. I trust that he is kind to her. There is\\r\\na dry glitter in his eyes and a firm set of his thin lips, which goes\\r\\nwith a positive and possibly a harsh nature. You would find him an\\r\\ninteresting study.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came over to call upon Baskerville on that first day, and the very\\r\\nnext morning he took us both to show us the spot where the legend of the\\r\\nwicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin. It was an excursion of\\r\\nsome miles across the moor to a place which is so dismal that it might\\r\\nhave suggested the story. We found a short valley between rugged tors\\r\\nwhich led to an open, grassy space flecked over with the white cotton\\r\\ngrass. In the middle of it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at\\r\\nthe upper end until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some\\r\\nmonstrous beast. In every way it corresponded with the scene of the old\\r\\ntragedy. Sir Henry was much interested and asked Stapleton more\\r\\nthan once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the\\r\\ninterference of the supernatural in the affairs of men. He spoke\\r\\nlightly, but it was evident that he was very much in earnest. Stapleton\\r\\nwas guarded in his replies, but it was easy to see that he said less\\r\\nthan he might, and that he would not express his whole opinion out of\\r\\nconsideration for the feelings of the baronet. He told us of similar\\r\\ncases, where families had suffered from some evil influence, and he left\\r\\nus with the impression that he shared the popular view upon the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it was there\\r\\nthat Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton. From the first\\r\\nmoment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted by her, and\\r\\nI am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual. He referred to her\\r\\nagain and again on our walk home, and since then hardly a day has passed\\r\\nthat we have not seen something of the brother and sister. They dine\\r\\nhere tonight, and there is some talk of our going to them next week. One\\r\\nwould imagine that such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton, and\\r\\nyet I have more than once caught a look of the strongest disapprobation\\r\\nin his face when Sir Henry has been paying some attention to his sister.\\r\\nHe is much attached to her, no doubt, and would lead a lonely life\\r\\nwithout her, but it would seem the height of selfishness if he were to\\r\\nstand in the way of her making so brilliant a marriage. Yet I am certain\\r\\nthat he does not wish their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have\\r\\nseveral times observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from\\r\\nbeing tete-a-tete. By the way, your instructions to me never to allow\\r\\nSir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a love\\r\\naffair were to be added to our other difficulties. My popularity would\\r\\nsoon suffer if I were to carry out your orders to the letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other day--Thursday, to be more exact--Dr. Mortimer lunched with us.\\r\\nHe has been excavating a barrow at Long Down and has got a prehistoric\\r\\nskull which fills him with great joy. Never was there such a\\r\\nsingle-minded enthusiast as he! The Stapletons came in afterwards, and\\r\\nthe good doctor took us all to the yew alley at Sir Henry\\'s request to\\r\\nshow us exactly how everything occurred upon that fatal night. It is\\r\\na long, dismal walk, the yew alley, between two high walls of clipped\\r\\nhedge, with a narrow band of grass upon either side. At the far end is\\r\\nan old tumble-down summer-house. Halfway down is the moor-gate, where\\r\\nthe old gentleman left his cigar-ash. It is a white wooden gate with\\r\\na latch. Beyond it lies the wide moor. I remembered your theory of the\\r\\naffair and tried to picture all that had occurred. As the old man stood\\r\\nthere he saw something coming across the moor, something which terrified\\r\\nhim so that he lost his wits and ran and ran until he died of sheer\\r\\nhorror and exhaustion. There was the long, gloomy tunnel down which\\r\\nhe fled. And from what? A sheep-dog of the moor? Or a spectral hound,\\r\\nblack, silent, and monstrous? Was there a human agency in the matter?\\r\\nDid the pale, watchful Barrymore know more than he cared to say? It was\\r\\nall dim and vague, but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr.\\r\\nFrankland, of Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles to the south of us.\\r\\nHe is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and choleric. His passion\\r\\nis for the British law, and he has spent a large fortune in litigation.\\r\\nHe fights for the mere pleasure of fighting and is equally ready to take\\r\\nup either side of a question, so that it is no wonder that he has found\\r\\nit a costly amusement. Sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy\\r\\nthe parish to make him open it. At others he will with his own hands\\r\\ntear down some other man\\'s gate and declare that a path has existed\\r\\nthere from time immemorial, defying the owner to prosecute him for\\r\\ntrespass. He is learned in old manorial and communal rights, and he\\r\\napplies his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villagers of Fernworthy\\r\\nand sometimes against them, so that he is periodically either carried in\\r\\ntriumph down the village street or else burned in effigy, according to\\r\\nhis latest exploit. He is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his\\r\\nhands at present, which will probably swallow up the remainder of his\\r\\nfortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the future.\\r\\nApart from the law he seems a kindly, good-natured person, and I\\r\\nonly mention him because you were particular that I should send some\\r\\ndescription of the people who surround us. He is curiously employed\\r\\nat present, for, being an amateur astronomer, he has an excellent\\r\\ntelescope, with which he lies upon the roof of his own house and sweeps\\r\\nthe moor all day in the hope of catching a glimpse of the escaped\\r\\nconvict. If he would confine his energies to this all would be well, but\\r\\nthere are rumours that he intends to prosecute Dr. Mortimer for opening\\r\\na grave without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the\\r\\nNeolithic skull in the barrow on Long Down. He helps to keep our lives\\r\\nfrom being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where it is badly\\r\\nneeded.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict, the\\r\\nStapletons, Dr. Mortimer, and Frankland, of Lafter Hall, let me end on\\r\\nthat which is most important and tell you more about the Barrymores, and\\r\\nespecially about the surprising development of last night.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst of all about the test telegram, which you sent from London in\\r\\norder to make sure that Barrymore was really here. I have already\\r\\nexplained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that the test was\\r\\nworthless and that we have no proof one way or the other. I told Sir\\r\\nHenry how the matter stood, and he at once, in his downright fashion,\\r\\nhad Barrymore up and asked him whether he had received the telegram\\r\\nhimself. Barrymore said that he had.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?\" asked Sir Henry.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said he, \"I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife brought\\r\\nit up to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you answer it yourself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I could not quite understand the object of your questions this morning,\\r\\nSir Henry,\" said he. \"I trust that they do not mean that I have done\\r\\nanything to forfeit your confidence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by giving\\r\\nhim a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the London outfit having\\r\\nnow all arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She is a heavy, solid person, very\\r\\nlimited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be puritanical. You\\r\\ncould hardly conceive a less emotional subject. Yet I have told you how,\\r\\non the first night here, I heard her sobbing bitterly, and since then\\r\\nI have more than once observed traces of tears upon her face. Some deep\\r\\nsorrow gnaws ever at her heart. Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty\\r\\nmemory which haunts her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a\\r\\ndomestic tyrant. I have always felt that there was something singular\\r\\nand questionable in this man\\'s character, but the adventure of last\\r\\nnight brings all my suspicions to a head.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware that I am\\r\\nnot a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard in this house\\r\\nmy slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night, about two in the\\r\\nmorning, I was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room. I rose,\\r\\nopened my door, and peeped out. A long black shadow was trailing down\\r\\nthe corridor. It was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage\\r\\nwith a candle held in his hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no\\r\\ncovering to his feet. I could merely see the outline, but his height\\r\\ntold me that it was Barrymore. He walked very slowly and circumspectly,\\r\\nand there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole\\r\\nappearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs\\r\\nround the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther side. I waited\\r\\nuntil he had passed out of sight and then I followed him. When I came\\r\\nround the balcony he had reached the end of the farther corridor, and\\r\\nI could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he\\r\\nhad entered one of the rooms. Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and\\r\\nunoccupied so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever. The\\r\\nlight shone steadily as if he were standing motionless. I crept down\\r\\nthe passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of the\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the\\r\\nglass. His profile was half turned towards me, and his face seemed to be\\r\\nrigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor.\\r\\nFor some minutes he stood watching intently. Then he gave a deep groan\\r\\nand with an impatient gesture he put out the light. Instantly I made my\\r\\nway back to my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing\\r\\nonce more upon their return journey. Long afterwards when I had fallen\\r\\ninto a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock, but I could\\r\\nnot tell whence the sound came. What it all means I cannot guess, but\\r\\nthere is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which\\r\\nsooner or later we shall get to the bottom of. I do not trouble you with\\r\\nmy theories, for you asked me to furnish you only with facts. I have\\r\\nhad a long talk with Sir Henry this morning, and we have made a plan of\\r\\ncampaign founded upon my observations of last night. I will not speak\\r\\nabout it just now, but it should make my next report interesting\\r\\nreading.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 9. The Light upon the Moor [Second Report of Dr. Watson]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBaskerville Hall, Oct. 15th. MY DEAR HOLMES: If I was compelled to\\r\\nleave you without much news during the early days of my mission you must\\r\\nacknowledge that I am making up for lost time, and that events are now\\r\\ncrowding thick and fast upon us. In my last report I ended upon my top\\r\\nnote with Barrymore at the window, and now I have quite a budget already\\r\\nwhich will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you. Things\\r\\nhave taken a turn which I could not have anticipated. In some ways they\\r\\nhave within the last forty-eight hours become much clearer and in some\\r\\nways they have become more complicated. But I will tell you all and you\\r\\nshall judge for yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore breakfast on the morning following my adventure I went down the\\r\\ncorridor and examined the room in which Barrymore had been on the night\\r\\nbefore. The western window through which he had stared so intently has,\\r\\nI noticed, one peculiarity above all other windows in the house--it\\r\\ncommands the nearest outlook on to the moor. There is an opening between\\r\\ntwo trees which enables one from this point of view to look right down\\r\\nupon it, while from all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse\\r\\nwhich can be obtained. It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since\\r\\nonly this window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out for\\r\\nsomething or somebody upon the moor. The night was very dark, so that I\\r\\ncan hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone. It had struck\\r\\nme that it was possible that some love intrigue was on foot. That would\\r\\nhave accounted for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness\\r\\nof his wife. The man is a striking-looking fellow, very well equipped\\r\\nto steal the heart of a country girl, so that this theory seemed to\\r\\nhave something to support it. That opening of the door which I had heard\\r\\nafter I had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep\\r\\nsome clandestine appointment. So I reasoned with myself in the morning,\\r\\nand I tell you the direction of my suspicions, however much the result\\r\\nmay have shown that they were unfounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut whatever the true explanation of Barrymore\\'s movements might be,\\r\\nI felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself until I could\\r\\nexplain them was more than I could bear. I had an interview with the\\r\\nbaronet in his study after breakfast, and I told him all that I had\\r\\nseen. He was less surprised than I had expected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knew that Barrymore walked about nights, and I had a mind to speak\\r\\nto him about it,\" said he. \"Two or three times I have heard his steps in\\r\\nthe passage, coming and going, just about the hour you name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular window,\" I\\r\\nsuggested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps he does. If so, we should be able to shadow him and see what\\r\\nit is that he is after. I wonder what your friend Holmes would do if he\\r\\nwere here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest,\" said I. \"He\\r\\nwould follow Barrymore and see what he did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then we shall do it together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But surely he would hear us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The man is rather deaf, and in any case we must take our chance of\\r\\nthat. We\\'ll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he passes.\" Sir\\r\\nHenry rubbed his hands with pleasure, and it was evident that he hailed\\r\\nthe adventure as a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe baronet has been in communication with the architect who prepared\\r\\nthe plans for Sir Charles, and with a contractor from London, so that we\\r\\nmay expect great changes to begin here soon. There have been decorators\\r\\nand furnishers up from Plymouth, and it is evident that our friend\\r\\nhas large ideas and means to spare no pains or expense to restore the\\r\\ngrandeur of his family. When the house is renovated and refurnished, all\\r\\nthat he will need will be a wife to make it complete. Between ourselves\\r\\nthere are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady\\r\\nis willing, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a woman\\r\\nthan he is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton. And yet the\\r\\ncourse of true love does not run quite as smoothly as one would under\\r\\nthe circumstances expect. Today, for example, its surface was broken\\r\\nby a very unexpected ripple, which has caused our friend considerable\\r\\nperplexity and annoyance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir Henry\\r\\nput on his hat and prepared to go out. As a matter of course I did the\\r\\nsame.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, are you coming, Watson?\" he asked, looking at me in a curious\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That depends on whether you are going on the moor,\" said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry to intrude, but\\r\\nyou heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not leave you, and\\r\\nespecially that you should not go alone upon the moor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear fellow,\" said he, \"Holmes, with all his wisdom, did not foresee\\r\\nsome things which have happened since I have been on the moor. You\\r\\nunderstand me? I am sure that you are the last man in the world who\\r\\nwould wish to be a spoil-sport. I must go out alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt put me in a most awkward position. I was at a loss what to say or\\r\\nwhat to do, and before I had made up my mind he picked up his cane and\\r\\nwas gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when I came to think the matter over my conscience reproached me\\r\\nbitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my sight.\\r\\nI imagined what my feelings would be if I had to return to you and to\\r\\nconfess that some misfortune had occurred through my disregard for your\\r\\ninstructions. I assure you my cheeks flushed at the very thought. It\\r\\nmight not even now be too late to overtake him, so I set off at once in\\r\\nthe direction of Merripit House.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing anything\\r\\nof Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor path branches\\r\\noff. There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the wrong direction after\\r\\nall, I mounted a hill from which I could command a view--the same hill\\r\\nwhich is cut into the dark quarry. Thence I saw him at once. He was on\\r\\nthe moor path about a quarter of a mile off, and a lady was by his side\\r\\nwho could only be Miss Stapleton. It was clear that there was already\\r\\nan understanding between them and that they had met by appointment. They\\r\\nwere walking slowly along in deep conversation, and I saw her making\\r\\nquick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest in what\\r\\nshe was saying, while he listened intently, and once or twice shook his\\r\\nhead in strong dissent. I stood among the rocks watching them, very much\\r\\npuzzled as to what I should do next. To follow them and break into their\\r\\nintimate conversation seemed to be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was\\r\\nnever for an instant to let him out of my sight. To act the spy upon a\\r\\nfriend was a hateful task. Still, I could see no better course than to\\r\\nobserve him from the hill, and to clear my conscience by confessing to\\r\\nhim afterwards what I had done. It is true that if any sudden danger had\\r\\nthreatened him I was too far away to be of use, and yet I am sure that\\r\\nyou will agree with me that the position was very difficult, and that\\r\\nthere was nothing more which I could do.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path and were\\r\\nstanding deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was suddenly\\r\\naware that I was not the only witness of their interview. A wisp of\\r\\ngreen floating in the air caught my eye, and another glance showed me\\r\\nthat it was carried on a stick by a man who was moving among the broken\\r\\nground. It was Stapleton with his butterfly-net. He was very much closer\\r\\nto the pair than I was, and he appeared to be moving in their direction.\\r\\nAt this instant Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton to his side. His\\r\\narm was round her, but it seemed to me that she was straining away from\\r\\nhim with her face averted. He stooped his head to hers, and she raised\\r\\none hand as if in protest. Next moment I saw them spring apart and turn\\r\\nhurriedly round. Stapleton was the cause of the interruption. He was\\r\\nrunning wildly towards them, his absurd net dangling behind him. He\\r\\ngesticulated and almost danced with excitement in front of the lovers.\\r\\nWhat the scene meant I could not imagine, but it seemed to me that\\r\\nStapleton was abusing Sir Henry, who offered explanations, which became\\r\\nmore angry as the other refused to accept them. The lady stood by in\\r\\nhaughty silence. Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in\\r\\na peremptory way to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at Sir\\r\\nHenry, walked off by the side of her brother. The naturalist\\'s angry\\r\\ngestures showed that the lady was included in his displeasure. The\\r\\nbaronet stood for a minute looking after them, and then he walked slowly\\r\\nback the way that he had come, his head hanging, the very picture of\\r\\ndejection.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed to\\r\\nhave witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend\\'s knowledge. I ran\\r\\ndown the hill therefore and met the baronet at the bottom. His face was\\r\\nflushed with anger and his brows were wrinkled, like one who is at his\\r\\nwit\\'s ends what to do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Halloa, Watson! Where have you dropped from?\" said he. \"You don\\'t mean\\r\\nto say that you came after me in spite of all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible to remain\\r\\nbehind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed all that\\r\\nhad occurred. For an instant his eyes blazed at me, but my frankness\\r\\ndisarmed his anger, and he broke at last into a rather rueful laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe\\r\\nplace for a man to be private,\" said he, \"but, by thunder, the whole\\r\\ncountryside seems to have been out to see me do my wooing--and a mighty\\r\\npoor wooing at that! Where had you engaged a seat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was on that hill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite in the back row, eh? But her brother was well up to the front.\\r\\nDid you see him come out on us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did he ever strike you as being crazy--this brother of hers?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t say that he ever did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say not. I always thought him sane enough until today, but you\\r\\ncan take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a straitjacket.\\r\\nWhat\\'s the matter with me, anyhow? You\\'ve lived near me for some weeks,\\r\\nWatson. Tell me straight, now! Is there anything that would prevent me\\r\\nfrom making a good husband to a woman that I loved?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should say not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He can\\'t object to my worldly position, so it must be myself that he\\r\\nhas this down on. What has he against me? I never hurt man or woman in\\r\\nmy life that I know of. And yet he would not so much as let me touch the\\r\\ntips of her fingers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did he say so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I\\'ve only known her these\\r\\nfew weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made for me,\\r\\nand she, too--she was happy when she was with me, and that I\\'ll swear.\\r\\nThere\\'s a light in a woman\\'s eyes that speaks louder than words. But he\\r\\nhas never let us get together and it was only today for the first time\\r\\nthat I saw a chance of having a few words with her alone. She was glad\\r\\nto meet me, but when she did it was not love that she would talk about,\\r\\nand she wouldn\\'t have let me talk about it either if she could have\\r\\nstopped it. She kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger,\\r\\nand that she would never be happy until I had left it. I told her that\\r\\nsince I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if she\\r\\nreally wanted me to go, the only way to work it was for her to arrange\\r\\nto go with me. With that I offered in as many words to marry her, but\\r\\nbefore she could answer, down came this brother of hers, running at us\\r\\nwith a face on him like a madman. He was just white with rage, and those\\r\\nlight eyes of his were blazing with fury. What was I doing with the\\r\\nlady? How dared I offer her attentions which were distasteful to her?\\r\\nDid I think that because I was a baronet I could do what I liked? If he\\r\\nhad not been her brother I should have known better how to answer him.\\r\\nAs it was I told him that my feelings towards his sister were such as\\r\\nI was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she might honour me by\\r\\nbecoming my wife. That seemed to make the matter no better, so then I\\r\\nlost my temper too, and I answered him rather more hotly than I should\\r\\nperhaps, considering that she was standing by. So it ended by his going\\r\\noff with her, as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any\\r\\nin this county. Just tell me what it all means, Watson, and I\\'ll owe you\\r\\nmore than ever I can hope to pay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely puzzled\\r\\nmyself. Our friend\\'s title, his fortune, his age, his character, and his\\r\\nappearance are all in his favour, and I know nothing against him unless\\r\\nit be this dark fate which runs in his family. That his advances should\\r\\nbe rejected so brusquely without any reference to the lady\\'s own wishes\\r\\nand that the lady should accept the situation without protest is very\\r\\namazing. However, our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from\\r\\nStapleton himself that very afternoon. He had come to offer apologies\\r\\nfor his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview with\\r\\nSir Henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was that the\\r\\nbreach is quite healed, and that we are to dine at Merripit House next\\r\\nFriday as a sign of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t say now that he isn\\'t a crazy man,\" said Sir Henry; \"I can\\'t\\r\\nforget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning, but I must\\r\\nallow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he has done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did he give any explanation of his conduct?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His sister is everything in his life, he says. That is natural enough,\\r\\nand I am glad that he should understand her value. They have always been\\r\\ntogether, and according to his account he has been a very lonely man\\r\\nwith only her as a companion, so that the thought of losing her was\\r\\nreally terrible to him. He had not understood, he said, that I was\\r\\nbecoming attached to her, but when he saw with his own eyes that it was\\r\\nreally so, and that she might be taken away from him, it gave him such a\\r\\nshock that for a time he was not responsible for what he said or did.\\r\\nHe was very sorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish\\r\\nand how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a\\r\\nbeautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life. If she\\r\\nhad to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to\\r\\nanyone else. But in any case it was a blow to him and it would take him\\r\\nsome time before he could prepare himself to meet it. He would withdraw\\r\\nall opposition upon his part if I would promise for three months to let\\r\\nthe matter rest and to be content with cultivating the lady\\'s friendship\\r\\nduring that time without claiming her love. This I promised, and so the\\r\\nmatter rests.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. It is something to\\r\\nhave touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we are floundering.\\r\\nWe know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour upon his sister\\'s\\r\\nsuitor--even when that suitor was so eligible a one as Sir Henry. And\\r\\nnow I pass on to another thread which I have extricated out of the\\r\\ntangled skein, the mystery of the sobs in the night, of the tear-stained\\r\\nface of Mrs. Barrymore, of the secret journey of the butler to the\\r\\nwestern lattice window. Congratulate me, my dear Holmes, and tell me\\r\\nthat I have not disappointed you as an agent--that you do not regret\\r\\nthe confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down. All these\\r\\nthings have by one night\\'s work been thoroughly cleared.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have said \"by one night\\'s work,\" but, in truth, it was by two nights\\'\\r\\nwork, for on the first we drew entirely blank. I sat up with Sir Henry\\r\\nin his rooms until nearly three o\\'clock in the morning, but no sound of\\r\\nany sort did we hear except the chiming clock upon the stairs. It was\\r\\na most melancholy vigil and ended by each of us falling asleep in our\\r\\nchairs. Fortunately we were not discouraged, and we determined to try\\r\\nagain. The next night we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes\\r\\nwithout making the least sound. It was incredible how slowly the hours\\r\\ncrawled by, and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of\\r\\npatient interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into\\r\\nwhich he hopes the game may wander. One struck, and two, and we had\\r\\nalmost for the second time given it up in despair when in an instant we\\r\\nboth sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary senses keenly on\\r\\nthe alert once more. We had heard the creak of a step in the passage.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the\\r\\ndistance. Then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out in\\r\\npursuit. Already our man had gone round the gallery and the corridor was\\r\\nall in darkness. Softly we stole along until we had come into the other\\r\\nwing. We were just in time to catch a glimpse of the tall, black-bearded\\r\\nfigure, his shoulders rounded as he tiptoed down the passage. Then he\\r\\npassed through the same door as before, and the light of the candle\\r\\nframed it in the darkness and shot one single yellow beam across the\\r\\ngloom of the corridor. We shuffled cautiously towards it, trying every\\r\\nplank before we dared to put our whole weight upon it. We had taken the\\r\\nprecaution of leaving our boots behind us, but, even so, the old boards\\r\\nsnapped and creaked beneath our tread. Sometimes it seemed impossible\\r\\nthat he should fail to hear our approach. However, the man is\\r\\nfortunately rather deaf, and he was entirely preoccupied in that which\\r\\nhe was doing. When at last we reached the door and peeped through we\\r\\nfound him crouching at the window, candle in hand, his white, intent\\r\\nface pressed against the pane, exactly as I had seen him two nights\\r\\nbefore.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had arranged no plan of campaign, but the baronet is a man to whom\\r\\nthe most direct way is always the most natural. He walked into the room,\\r\\nand as he did so Barrymore sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss\\r\\nof his breath and stood, livid and trembling, before us. His dark eyes,\\r\\nglaring out of the white mask of his face, were full of horror and\\r\\nastonishment as he gazed from Sir Henry to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you doing here, Barrymore?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing, sir.\" His agitation was so great that he could hardly speak,\\r\\nand the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his candle. \"It\\r\\nwas the window, sir. I go round at night to see that they are fastened.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the second floor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, all the windows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here, Barrymore,\" said Sir Henry sternly, \"we have made up our\\r\\nminds to have the truth out of you, so it will save you trouble to tell\\r\\nit sooner rather than later. Come, now! No lies! What were you doing at\\r\\nthat window?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fellow looked at us in a helpless way, and he wrung his hands\\r\\ntogether like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and misery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was doing no harm, sir. I was holding a candle to the window.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why were you holding a candle to the window?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t ask me, Sir Henry--don\\'t ask me! I give you my word, sir, that it\\r\\nis not my secret, and that I cannot tell it. If it concerned no one but\\r\\nmyself I would not try to keep it from you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA sudden idea occurred to me, and I took the candle from the trembling\\r\\nhand of the butler.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He must have been holding it as a signal,\" said I. \"Let us see if\\r\\nthere is any answer.\" I held it as he had done, and stared out into the\\r\\ndarkness of the night. Vaguely I could discern the black bank of the\\r\\ntrees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for the moon was behind the\\r\\nclouds. And then I gave a cry of exultation, for a tiny pinpoint of\\r\\nyellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil, and glowed steadily\\r\\nin the centre of the black square framed by the window.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There it is!\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, sir, it is nothing--nothing at all!\" the butler broke in; \"I\\r\\nassure you, sir--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Move your light across the window, Watson!\" cried the baronet. \"See,\\r\\nthe other moves also! Now, you rascal, do you deny that it is a signal?\\r\\nCome, speak up! Who is your confederate out yonder, and what is this\\r\\nconspiracy that is going on?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man\\'s face became openly defiant. \"It is my business, and not yours.\\r\\nI will not tell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you leave my employment right away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good, sir. If I must I must.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you go in disgrace. By thunder, you may well be ashamed of\\r\\nyourself. Your family has lived with mine for over a hundred years under\\r\\nthis roof, and here I find you deep in some dark plot against me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, sir; no, not against you!\" It was a woman\\'s voice, and Mrs.\\r\\nBarrymore, paler and more horror-struck than her husband, was standing\\r\\nat the door. Her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt might have been comic\\r\\nwere it not for the intensity of feeling upon her face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have to go, Eliza. This is the end of it. You can pack our things,\"\\r\\nsaid the butler.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, John, John, have I brought you to this? It is my doing, Sir\\r\\nHenry--all mine. He has done nothing except for my sake and because I\\r\\nasked him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Speak out, then! What does it mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My unhappy brother is starving on the moor. We cannot let him perish at\\r\\nour very gates. The light is a signal to him that food is ready for him,\\r\\nand his light out yonder is to show the spot to which to bring it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then your brother is--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The escaped convict, sir--Selden, the criminal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the truth, sir,\" said Barrymore. \"I said that it was not my\\r\\nsecret and that I could not tell it to you. But now you have heard it,\\r\\nand you will see that if there was a plot it was not against you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, then, was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at night\\r\\nand the light at the window. Sir Henry and I both stared at the woman in\\r\\namazement. Was it possible that this stolidly respectable person was of\\r\\nthe same blood as one of the most notorious criminals in the country?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, my name was Selden, and he is my younger brother. We humoured\\r\\nhim too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way in everything\\r\\nuntil he came to think that the world was made for his pleasure, and\\r\\nthat he could do what he liked in it. Then as he grew older he met\\r\\nwicked companions, and the devil entered into him until he broke my\\r\\nmother\\'s heart and dragged our name in the dirt. From crime to crime\\r\\nhe sank lower and lower until it is only the mercy of God which has\\r\\nsnatched him from the scaffold; but to me, sir, he was always the little\\r\\ncurly-headed boy that I had nursed and played with as an elder sister\\r\\nwould. That was why he broke prison, sir. He knew that I was here and\\r\\nthat we could not refuse to help him. When he dragged himself here one\\r\\nnight, weary and starving, with the warders hard at his heels, what\\r\\ncould we do? We took him in and fed him and cared for him. Then you\\r\\nreturned, sir, and my brother thought he would be safer on the moor than\\r\\nanywhere else until the hue and cry was over, so he lay in hiding there.\\r\\nBut every second night we made sure if he was still there by putting a\\r\\nlight in the window, and if there was an answer my husband took out some\\r\\nbread and meat to him. Every day we hoped that he was gone, but as long\\r\\nas he was there we could not desert him. That is the whole truth, as I\\r\\nam an honest Christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in\\r\\nthe matter it does not lie with my husband but with me, for whose sake\\r\\nhe has done all that he has.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman\\'s words came with an intense earnestness which carried\\r\\nconviction with them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this true, Barrymore?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Sir Henry. Every word of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I cannot blame you for standing by your own wife. Forget what\\r\\nI have said. Go to your room, you two, and we shall talk further about\\r\\nthis matter in the morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were gone we looked out of the window again. Sir Henry had\\r\\nflung it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon our faces. Far away\\r\\nin the black distance there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow\\r\\nlight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder he dares,\" said Sir Henry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may be so placed as to be only visible from here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very likely. How far do you think it is?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Out by the Cleft Tor, I think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not more than a mile or two off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hardly that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it cannot be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food to it.\\r\\nAnd he is waiting, this villain, beside that candle. By thunder, Watson,\\r\\nI am going out to take that man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same thought had crossed my own mind. It was not as if the\\r\\nBarrymores had taken us into their confidence. Their secret had been\\r\\nforced from them. The man was a danger to the community, an unmitigated\\r\\nscoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse. We were only doing\\r\\nour duty in taking this chance of putting him back where he could do no\\r\\nharm. With his brutal and violent nature, others would have to pay the\\r\\nprice if we held our hands. Any night, for example, our neighbours the\\r\\nStapletons might be attacked by him, and it may have been the thought of\\r\\nthis which made Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will come,\" said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then get your revolver and put on your boots. The sooner we start the\\r\\nbetter, as the fellow may put out his light and be off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn five minutes we were outside the door, starting upon our expedition.\\r\\nWe hurried through the dark shrubbery, amid the dull moaning of the\\r\\nautumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves. The night air was\\r\\nheavy with the smell of damp and decay. Now and again the moon peeped\\r\\nout for an instant, but clouds were driving over the face of the sky,\\r\\nand just as we came out on the moor a thin rain began to fall. The light\\r\\nstill burned steadily in front.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you armed?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a hunting-crop.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must close in on him rapidly, for he is said to be a desperate\\r\\nfellow. We shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy before\\r\\nhe can resist.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say, Watson,\" said the baronet, \"what would Holmes say to this? How\\r\\nabout that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is exalted?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom\\r\\nof the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon the borders\\r\\nof the great Grimpen Mire. It came with the wind through the silence\\r\\nof the night, a long, deep mutter, then a rising howl, and then the sad\\r\\nmoan in which it died away. Again and again it sounded, the whole air\\r\\nthrobbing with it, strident, wild, and menacing. The baronet caught my\\r\\nsleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My God, what\\'s that, Watson?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know. It\\'s a sound they have on the moor. I heard it once\\r\\nbefore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. We stood\\r\\nstraining our ears, but nothing came.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Watson,\" said the baronet, \"it was the cry of a hound.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his voice which\\r\\ntold of the sudden horror which had seized him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do they call this sound?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The folk on the countryside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, they are ignorant people. Why should you mind what they call it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell me, Watson. What do they say of it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI hesitated but could not escape the question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They say it is the cry of the Hound of the Baskervilles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe groaned and was silent for a few moments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A hound it was,\" he said at last, \"but it seemed to come from miles\\r\\naway, over yonder, I think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was hard to say whence it came.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It rose and fell with the wind. Isn\\'t that the direction of the great\\r\\nGrimpen Mire?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it was up there. Come now, Watson, didn\\'t you think yourself that\\r\\nit was the cry of a hound? I am not a child. You need not fear to speak\\r\\nthe truth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stapleton was with me when I heard it last. He said that it might be\\r\\nthe calling of a strange bird.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, it was a hound. My God, can there be some truth in all these\\r\\nstories? Is it possible that I am really in danger from so dark a cause?\\r\\nYou don\\'t believe it, do you, Watson?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet it was one thing to laugh about it in London, and it is another\\r\\nto stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as\\r\\nthat. And my uncle! There was the footprint of the hound beside him as\\r\\nhe lay. It all fits together. I don\\'t think that I am a coward, Watson,\\r\\nbut that sound seemed to freeze my very blood. Feel my hand!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was as cold as a block of marble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll be all right tomorrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think I\\'ll get that cry out of my head. What do you advise that\\r\\nwe do now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall we turn back?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, by thunder; we have come out to get our man, and we will do it. We\\r\\nafter the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not, after us. Come\\r\\non! We\\'ll see it through if all the fiends of the pit were loose upon\\r\\nthe moor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stumbled slowly along in the darkness, with the black loom of the\\r\\ncraggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light burning steadily\\r\\nin front. There is nothing so deceptive as the distance of a light upon\\r\\na pitch-dark night, and sometimes the glimmer seemed to be far away upon\\r\\nthe horizon and sometimes it might have been within a few yards of us.\\r\\nBut at last we could see whence it came, and then we knew that we were\\r\\nindeed very close. A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the\\r\\nrocks which flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it\\r\\nand also to prevent it from being visible, save in the direction of\\r\\nBaskerville Hall. A boulder of granite concealed our approach, and\\r\\ncrouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light. It was strange\\r\\nto see this single candle burning there in the middle of the moor, with\\r\\nno sign of life near it--just the one straight yellow flame and the\\r\\ngleam of the rock on each side of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What shall we do now?\" whispered Sir Henry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait here. He must be near his light. Let us see if we can get a\\r\\nglimpse of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him. Over the\\r\\nrocks, in the crevice of which the candle burned, there was thrust out\\r\\nan evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all seamed and scored with\\r\\nvile passions. Foul with mire, with a bristling beard, and hung with\\r\\nmatted hair, it might well have belonged to one of those old savages\\r\\nwho dwelt in the burrows on the hillsides. The light beneath him was\\r\\nreflected in his small, cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and\\r\\nleft through the darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard\\r\\nthe steps of the hunters.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething had evidently aroused his suspicions. It may have been that\\r\\nBarrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to give, or\\r\\nthe fellow may have had some other reason for thinking that all was not\\r\\nwell, but I could read his fears upon his wicked face. Any instant he\\r\\nmight dash out the light and vanish in the darkness. I sprang forward\\r\\ntherefore, and Sir Henry did the same. At the same moment the convict\\r\\nscreamed out a curse at us and hurled a rock which splintered up against\\r\\nthe boulder which had sheltered us. I caught one glimpse of his short,\\r\\nsquat, strongly built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run.\\r\\nAt the same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds.\\r\\nWe rushed over the brow of the hill, and there was our man running with\\r\\ngreat speed down the other side, springing over the stones in his way\\r\\nwith the activity of a mountain goat. A lucky long shot of my revolver\\r\\nmight have crippled him, but I had brought it only to defend myself if\\r\\nattacked and not to shoot an unarmed man who was running away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were both swift runners and in fairly good training, but we soon\\r\\nfound that we had no chance of overtaking him. We saw him for a long\\r\\ntime in the moonlight until he was only a small speck moving swiftly\\r\\namong the boulders upon the side of a distant hill. We ran and ran until\\r\\nwe were completely blown, but the space between us grew ever wider.\\r\\nFinally we stopped and sat panting on two rocks, while we watched him\\r\\ndisappearing in the distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and\\r\\nunexpected thing. We had risen from our rocks and were turning to go\\r\\nhome, having abandoned the hopeless chase. The moon was low upon the\\r\\nright, and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up against the\\r\\nlower curve of its silver disc. There, outlined as black as an ebony\\r\\nstatue on that shining background, I saw the figure of a man upon the\\r\\ntor. Do not think that it was a delusion, Holmes. I assure you that\\r\\nI have never in my life seen anything more clearly. As far as I could\\r\\njudge, the figure was that of a tall, thin man. He stood with his legs\\r\\na little separated, his arms folded, his head bowed, as if he were\\r\\nbrooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which lay\\r\\nbefore him. He might have been the very spirit of that terrible place.\\r\\nIt was not the convict. This man was far from the place where the\\r\\nlatter had disappeared. Besides, he was a much taller man. With a cry\\r\\nof surprise I pointed him out to the baronet, but in the instant during\\r\\nwhich I had turned to grasp his arm the man was gone. There was the\\r\\nsharp pinnacle of granite still cutting the lower edge of the moon, but\\r\\nits peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figure.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wished to go in that direction and to search the tor, but it was some\\r\\ndistance away. The baronet\\'s nerves were still quivering from that cry,\\r\\nwhich recalled the dark story of his family, and he was not in the mood\\r\\nfor fresh adventures. He had not seen this lonely man upon the tor and\\r\\ncould not feel the thrill which his strange presence and his commanding\\r\\nattitude had given to me. \"A warder, no doubt,\" said he. \"The moor\\r\\nhas been thick with them since this fellow escaped.\" Well, perhaps his\\r\\nexplanation may be the right one, but I should like to have some further\\r\\nproof of it. Today we mean to communicate to the Princetown people where\\r\\nthey should look for their missing man, but it is hard lines that\\r\\nwe have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our\\r\\nown prisoner. Such are the adventures of last night, and you must\\r\\nacknowledge, my dear Holmes, that I have done you very well in\\r\\nthe matter of a report. Much of what I tell you is no doubt quite\\r\\nirrelevant, but still I feel that it is best that I should let you have\\r\\nall the facts and leave you to select for yourself those which will\\r\\nbe of most service to you in helping you to your conclusions. We are\\r\\ncertainly making some progress. So far as the Barrymores go we have\\r\\nfound the motive of their actions, and that has cleared up the situation\\r\\nvery much. But the moor with its mysteries and its strange inhabitants\\r\\nremains as inscrutable as ever. Perhaps in my next I may be able to\\r\\nthrow some light upon this also. Best of all would it be if you could\\r\\ncome down to us. In any case you will hear from me again in the course\\r\\nof the next few days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 10. Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far I have been able to quote from the reports which I have forwarded\\r\\nduring these early days to Sherlock Holmes. Now, however, I have arrived\\r\\nat a point in my narrative where I am compelled to abandon this method\\r\\nand to trust once more to my recollections, aided by the diary which\\r\\nI kept at the time. A few extracts from the latter will carry me on to\\r\\nthose scenes which are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory. I\\r\\nproceed, then, from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the\\r\\nconvict and our other strange experiences upon the moor.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 16th. A dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain. The house\\r\\nis banked in with rolling clouds, which rise now and then to show the\\r\\ndreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver veins upon the sides of the\\r\\nhills, and the distant boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon\\r\\ntheir wet faces. It is melancholy outside and in. The baronet is in a\\r\\nblack reaction after the excitements of the night. I am conscious myself\\r\\nof a weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger--ever present\\r\\ndanger, which is the more terrible because I am unable to define it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd have I not cause for such a feeling? Consider the long sequence of\\r\\nincidents which have all pointed to some sinister influence which is\\r\\nat work around us. There is the death of the last occupant of the Hall,\\r\\nfulfilling so exactly the conditions of the family legend, and there\\r\\nare the repeated reports from peasants of the appearance of a strange\\r\\ncreature upon the moor. Twice I have with my own ears heard the sound\\r\\nwhich resembled the distant baying of a hound. It is incredible,\\r\\nimpossible, that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of\\r\\nnature. A spectral hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the\\r\\nair with its howling is surely not to be thought of. Stapleton may\\r\\nfall in with such a superstition, and Mortimer also, but if I have one\\r\\nquality upon earth it is common sense, and nothing will persuade me to\\r\\nbelieve in such a thing. To do so would be to descend to the level of\\r\\nthese poor peasants, who are not content with a mere fiend dog but must\\r\\nneeds describe him with hell-fire shooting from his mouth and eyes.\\r\\nHolmes would not listen to such fancies, and I am his agent. But facts\\r\\nare facts, and I have twice heard this crying upon the moor. Suppose\\r\\nthat there were really some huge hound loose upon it; that would go far\\r\\nto explain everything. But where could such a hound lie concealed, where\\r\\ndid it get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no one\\r\\nsaw it by day? It must be confessed that the natural explanation offers\\r\\nalmost as many difficulties as the other. And always, apart from the\\r\\nhound, there is the fact of the human agency in London, the man in the\\r\\ncab, and the letter which warned Sir Henry against the moor. This at\\r\\nleast was real, but it might have been the work of a protecting friend\\r\\nas easily as of an enemy. Where is that friend or enemy now? Has he\\r\\nremained in London, or has he followed us down here? Could he--could he\\r\\nbe the stranger whom I saw upon the tor?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is true that I have had only the one glance at him, and yet there are\\r\\nsome things to which I am ready to swear. He is no one whom I have seen\\r\\ndown here, and I have now met all the neighbours. The figure was far\\r\\ntaller than that of Stapleton, far thinner than that of Frankland.\\r\\nBarrymore it might possibly have been, but we had left him behind us,\\r\\nand I am certain that he could not have followed us. A stranger then is\\r\\nstill dogging us, just as a stranger dogged us in London. We have never\\r\\nshaken him off. If I could lay my hands upon that man, then at last we\\r\\nmight find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties. To this one\\r\\npurpose I must now devote all my energies.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my plans. My second and\\r\\nwisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as possible to\\r\\nanyone. He is silent and distrait. His nerves have been strangely shaken\\r\\nby that sound upon the moor. I will say nothing to add to his anxieties,\\r\\nbut I will take my own steps to attain my own end.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a small scene this morning after breakfast. Barrymore asked leave\\r\\nto speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in his study some little\\r\\ntime. Sitting in the billiard-room I more than once heard the sound of\\r\\nvoices raised, and I had a pretty good idea what the point was which was\\r\\nunder discussion. After a time the baronet opened his door and called\\r\\nfor me. \"Barrymore considers that he has a grievance,\" he said. \"He\\r\\nthinks that it was unfair on our part to hunt his brother-in-law down\\r\\nwhen he, of his own free will, had told us the secret.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe butler was standing very pale but very collected before us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I may have spoken too warmly, sir,\" said he, \"and if I have, I am sure\\r\\nthat I beg your pardon. At the same time, I was very much surprised when\\r\\nI heard you two gentlemen come back this morning and learned that you\\r\\nhad been chasing Selden. The poor fellow has enough to fight against\\r\\nwithout my putting more upon his track.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you had told us of your own free will it would have been a different\\r\\nthing,\" said the baronet, \"you only told us, or rather your wife only\\r\\ntold us, when it was forced from you and you could not help yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I didn\\'t think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir Henry--indeed\\r\\nI didn\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The man is a public danger. There are lonely houses scattered over the\\r\\nmoor, and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing. You only want to\\r\\nget a glimpse of his face to see that. Look at Mr. Stapleton\\'s house,\\r\\nfor example, with no one but himself to defend it. There\\'s no safety for\\r\\nanyone until he is under lock and key.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'ll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word upon that.\\r\\nBut he will never trouble anyone in this country again. I assure you,\\r\\nSir Henry, that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have\\r\\nbeen made and he will be on his way to South America. For God\\'s sake,\\r\\nsir, I beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the\\r\\nmoor. They have given up the chase there, and he can lie quiet until the\\r\\nship is ready for him. You can\\'t tell on him without getting my wife and\\r\\nme into trouble. I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you say, Watson?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI shrugged my shoulders. \"If he were safely out of the country it would\\r\\nrelieve the tax-payer of a burden.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He would not do anything so mad, sir. We have provided him with all\\r\\nthat he can want. To commit a crime would be to show where he was\\r\\nhiding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is true,\" said Sir Henry. \"Well, Barrymore--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart! It would have killed\\r\\nmy poor wife had he been taken again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson? But, after what\\r\\nwe have heard I don\\'t feel as if I could give the man up, so there is an\\r\\nend of it. All right, Barrymore, you can go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he hesitated\\r\\nand then came back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ve been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do the best I\\r\\ncan for you in return. I know something, Sir Henry, and perhaps I should\\r\\nhave said it before, but it was long after the inquest that I found it\\r\\nout. I\\'ve never breathed a word about it yet to mortal man. It\\'s about\\r\\npoor Sir Charles\\'s death.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe baronet and I were both upon our feet. \"Do you know how he died?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir, I don\\'t know that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know why he was at the gate at that hour. It was to meet a woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To meet a woman! He?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the woman\\'s name?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials. Her\\r\\ninitials were L. L.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you know this, Barrymore?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. He had usually a\\r\\ngreat many letters, for he was a public man and well known for his kind\\r\\nheart, so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him. But\\r\\nthat morning, as it chanced, there was only this one letter, so I took\\r\\nthe more notice of it. It was from Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed\\r\\nin a woman\\'s hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would have done\\r\\nhad it not been for my wife. Only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out\\r\\nSir Charles\\'s study--it had never been touched since his death--and she\\r\\nfound the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate. The greater\\r\\npart of it was charred to pieces, but one little slip, the end of a\\r\\npage, hung together, and the writing could still be read, though it was\\r\\ngray on a black ground. It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end\\r\\nof the letter and it said: \\'Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn\\r\\nthis letter, and be at the gate by ten o clock. Beneath it were signed\\r\\nthe initials L. L.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you got that slip?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. I should not\\r\\nhave noticed this one, only it happened to come alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you have no idea who L. L. is?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir. No more than you have. But I expect if we could lay our hands\\r\\nupon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles\\'s death.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot understand, Barrymore, how you came to conceal this important\\r\\ninformation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, sir, it was immediately after that our own trouble came to us.\\r\\nAnd then again, sir, we were both of us very fond of Sir Charles, as we\\r\\nwell might be considering all that he has done for us. To rake this\\r\\nup couldn\\'t help our poor master, and it\\'s well to go carefully when\\r\\nthere\\'s a lady in the case. Even the best of us--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You thought it might injure his reputation?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, sir, I thought no good could come of it. But now you have been\\r\\nkind to us, and I feel as if it would be treating you unfairly not to\\r\\ntell you all that I know about the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good, Barrymore; you can go.\" When the butler had left us Sir\\r\\nHenry turned to me. \"Well, Watson, what do you think of this new light?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I think. But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear up the whole\\r\\nbusiness. We have gained that much. We know that there is someone who\\r\\nhas the facts if we can only find her. What do you think we should do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let Holmes know all about it at once. It will give him the clue for\\r\\nwhich he has been seeking. I am much mistaken if it does not bring him\\r\\ndown.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning\\'s\\r\\nconversation for Holmes. It was evident to me that he had been very busy\\r\\nof late, for the notes which I had from Baker Street were few and short,\\r\\nwith no comments upon the information which I had supplied and hardly\\r\\nany reference to my mission. No doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing\\r\\nall his faculties. And yet this new factor must surely arrest his\\r\\nattention and renew his interest. I wish that he were here.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 17th. All day today the rain poured down, rustling on the ivy\\r\\nand dripping from the eaves. I thought of the convict out upon the\\r\\nbleak, cold, shelterless moor. Poor devil! Whatever his crimes, he has\\r\\nsuffered something to atone for them. And then I thought of that other\\r\\none--the face in the cab, the figure against the moon. Was he also out\\r\\nin that deluged--the unseen watcher, the man of darkness? In the evening\\r\\nI put on my waterproof and I walked far upon the sodden moor, full of\\r\\ndark imaginings, the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling\\r\\nabout my ears. God help those who wander into the great mire now, for\\r\\neven the firm uplands are becoming a morass. I found the black tor upon\\r\\nwhich I had seen the solitary watcher, and from its craggy summit I\\r\\nlooked out myself across the melancholy downs. Rain squalls drifted\\r\\nacross their russet face, and the heavy, slate-coloured clouds hung\\r\\nlow over the landscape, trailing in gray wreaths down the sides of the\\r\\nfantastic hills. In the distant hollow on the left, half hidden by the\\r\\nmist, the two thin towers of Baskerville Hall rose above the trees. They\\r\\nwere the only signs of human life which I could see, save only those\\r\\nprehistoric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills. Nowhere\\r\\nwas there any trace of that lonely man whom I had seen on the same spot\\r\\ntwo nights before.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mortimer driving in his dog-cart\\r\\nover a rough moorland track which led from the outlying farmhouse of\\r\\nFoulmire. He has been very attentive to us, and hardly a day has passed\\r\\nthat he has not called at the Hall to see how we were getting on. He\\r\\ninsisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart, and he gave me a lift\\r\\nhomeward. I found him much troubled over the disappearance of his little\\r\\nspaniel. It had wandered on to the moor and had never come back. I\\r\\ngave him such consolation as I might, but I thought of the pony on the\\r\\nGrimpen Mire, and I do not fancy that he will see his little dog again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By the way, Mortimer,\" said I as we jolted along the rough road, \"I\\r\\nsuppose there are few people living within driving distance of this whom\\r\\nyou do not know?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hardly any, I think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials are L. L.?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought for a few minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said he. \"There are a few gipsies and labouring folk for whom\\r\\nI can\\'t answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose\\r\\ninitials are those. Wait a bit though,\" he added after a pause. \"There\\r\\nis Laura Lyons--her initials are L. L.--but she lives in Coombe Tracey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is she?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is Frankland\\'s daughter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! Old Frankland the crank?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly. She married an artist named Lyons, who came sketching on the\\r\\nmoor. He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her. The fault from what\\r\\nI hear may not have been entirely on one side. Her father refused to\\r\\nhave anything to do with her because she had married without his consent\\r\\nand perhaps for one or two other reasons as well. So, between the old\\r\\nsinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How does she live?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be more,\\r\\nfor his own affairs are considerably involved. Whatever she may have\\r\\ndeserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad. Her story\\r\\ngot about, and several of the people here did something to enable her\\r\\nto earn an honest living. Stapleton did for one, and Sir Charles for\\r\\nanother. I gave a trifle myself. It was to set her up in a typewriting\\r\\nbusiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but I managed to satisfy\\r\\nhis curiosity without telling him too much, for there is no reason why\\r\\nwe should take anyone into our confidence. Tomorrow morning I shall\\r\\nfind my way to Coombe Tracey, and if I can see this Mrs. Laura Lyons, of\\r\\nequivocal reputation, a long step will have been made towards clearing\\r\\none incident in this chain of mysteries. I am certainly developing the\\r\\nwisdom of the serpent, for when Mortimer pressed his questions to an\\r\\ninconvenient extent I asked him casually to what type Frankland\\'s skull\\r\\nbelonged, and so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive.\\r\\nI have not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and\\r\\nmelancholy day. This was my conversation with Barrymore just now, which\\r\\ngives me one more strong card which I can play in due time.\\r\\n\\r\\nMortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and the baronet played ecarte\\r\\nafterwards. The butler brought me my coffee into the library, and I took\\r\\nthe chance to ask him a few questions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said I, \"has this precious relation of yours departed, or is he\\r\\nstill lurking out yonder?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know, sir. I hope to heaven that he has gone, for he has\\r\\nbrought nothing but trouble here! I\\'ve not heard of him since I left out\\r\\nfood for him last, and that was three days ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you see him then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then he was certainly there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who took it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at Barrymore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know that there is another man then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir; there is another man upon the moor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you seen him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you know of him then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Selden told me of him, sir, a week ago or more. He\\'s in hiding, too,\\r\\nbut he\\'s not a convict as far as I can make out. I don\\'t like it, Dr.\\r\\nWatson--I tell you straight, sir, that I don\\'t like it.\" He spoke with a\\r\\nsudden passion of earnestness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, listen to me, Barrymore! I have no interest in this matter but\\r\\nthat of your master. I have come here with no object except to help him.\\r\\nTell me, frankly, what it is that you don\\'t like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBarrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he regretted his outburst or\\r\\nfound it difficult to express his own feelings in words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s all these goings-on, sir,\" he cried at last, waving his hand\\r\\ntowards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor. \"There\\'s foul play\\r\\nsomewhere, and there\\'s black villainy brewing, to that I\\'ll swear!\\r\\nVery glad I should be, sir, to see Sir Henry on his way back to London\\r\\nagain!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what is it that alarms you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look at Sir Charles\\'s death! That was bad enough, for all that the\\r\\ncoroner said. Look at the noises on the moor at night. There\\'s not a\\r\\nman would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it. Look at this\\r\\nstranger hiding out yonder, and watching and waiting! What\\'s he waiting\\r\\nfor? What does it mean? It means no good to anyone of the name of\\r\\nBaskerville, and very glad I shall be to be quit of it all on the day\\r\\nthat Sir Henry\\'s new servants are ready to take over the Hall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But about this stranger,\" said I. \"Can you tell me anything about\\r\\nhim? What did Selden say? Did he find out where he hid, or what he was\\r\\ndoing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one and gives nothing away.\\r\\nAt first he thought that he was the police, but soon he found that he\\r\\nhad some lay of his own. A kind of gentleman he was, as far as he could\\r\\nsee, but what he was doing he could not make out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And where did he say that he lived?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Among the old houses on the hillside--the stone huts where the old folk\\r\\nused to live.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how about his food?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and brings all\\r\\nhe needs. I dare say he goes to Coombe Tracey for what he wants.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good, Barrymore. We may talk further of this some other time.\"\\r\\nWhen the butler had gone I walked over to the black window, and I looked\\r\\nthrough a blurred pane at the driving clouds and at the tossing outline\\r\\nof the wind-swept trees. It is a wild night indoors, and what must it\\r\\nbe in a stone hut upon the moor. What passion of hatred can it be which\\r\\nleads a man to lurk in such a place at such a time! And what deep and\\r\\nearnest purpose can he have which calls for such a trial! There, in that\\r\\nhut upon the moor, seems to lie the very centre of that problem which\\r\\nhas vexed me so sorely. I swear that another day shall not have passed\\r\\nbefore I have done all that man can do to reach the heart of the\\r\\nmystery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 11. The Man on the Tor\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter has\\r\\nbrought my narrative up to the eighteenth of October, a time when these\\r\\nstrange events began to move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion.\\r\\nThe incidents of the next few days are indelibly graven upon my\\r\\nrecollection, and I can tell them without reference to the notes made\\r\\nat the time. I start them from the day which succeeded that upon which\\r\\nI had established two facts of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura\\r\\nLyons of Coombe Tracey had written to Sir Charles Baskerville and made\\r\\nan appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his\\r\\ndeath, the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be found\\r\\namong the stone huts upon the hillside. With these two facts in my\\r\\npossession I felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be\\r\\ndeficient if I could not throw some further light upon these dark\\r\\nplaces.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I had learned about Mrs.\\r\\nLyons upon the evening before, for Dr. Mortimer remained with him at\\r\\ncards until it was very late. At breakfast, however, I informed him\\r\\nabout my discovery and asked him whether he would care to accompany\\r\\nme to Coombe Tracey. At first he was very eager to come, but on second\\r\\nthoughts it seemed to both of us that if I went alone the results might\\r\\nbe better. The more formal we made the visit the less information we\\r\\nmight obtain. I left Sir Henry behind, therefore, not without some\\r\\nprickings of conscience, and drove off upon my new quest.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins to put up the horses, and\\r\\nI made inquiries for the lady whom I had come to interrogate. I had no\\r\\ndifficulty in finding her rooms, which were central and well appointed.\\r\\nA maid showed me in without ceremony, and as I entered the sitting-room\\r\\na lady, who was sitting before a Remington typewriter, sprang up with a\\r\\npleasant smile of welcome. Her face fell, however, when she saw that\\r\\nI was a stranger, and she sat down again and asked me the object of my\\r\\nvisit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was one of extreme beauty. Her\\r\\neyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour, and her cheeks, though\\r\\nconsiderably freckled, were flushed with the exquisite bloom of the\\r\\nbrunette, the dainty pink which lurks at the heart of the sulphur rose.\\r\\nAdmiration was, I repeat, the first impression. But the second was\\r\\ncriticism. There was something subtly wrong with the face, some\\r\\ncoarseness of expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness\\r\\nof lip which marred its perfect beauty. But these, of course, are\\r\\nafterthoughts. At the moment I was simply conscious that I was in\\r\\nthe presence of a very handsome woman, and that she was asking me the\\r\\nreasons for my visit. I had not quite understood until that instant how\\r\\ndelicate my mission was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have the pleasure,\" said I, \"of knowing your father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a clumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it. \"There\\r\\nis nothing in common between my father and me,\" she said. \"I owe him\\r\\nnothing, and his friends are not mine. If it were not for the late Sir\\r\\nCharles Baskerville and some other kind hearts I might have starved for\\r\\nall that my father cared.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come here to\\r\\nsee you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe freckles started out on the lady\\'s face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can I tell you about him?\" she asked, and her fingers played\\r\\nnervously over the stops of her typewriter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You knew him, did you not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have already said that I owe a great deal to his kindness. If I am\\r\\nable to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he took\\r\\nin my unhappy situation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you correspond with him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the object of these questions?\" she asked sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The object is to avoid a public scandal. It is better that I should ask\\r\\nthem here than that the matter should pass outside our control.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was silent and her face was still very pale. At last she looked up\\r\\nwith something reckless and defiant in her manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'ll answer,\" she said. \"What are your questions?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you correspond with Sir Charles?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and\\r\\nhis generosity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you the dates of those letters?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you ever met him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, once or twice, when he came into Coombe Tracey. He was a very\\r\\nretiring man, and he preferred to do good by stealth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he know\\r\\nenough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say that he has\\r\\ndone?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe met my difficulty with the utmost readiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united to\\r\\nhelp me. One was Mr. Stapleton, a neighbour and intimate friend of Sir\\r\\nCharles\\'s. He was exceedingly kind, and it was through him that Sir\\r\\nCharles learned about my affairs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton his\\r\\nalmoner upon several occasions, so the lady\\'s statement bore the impress\\r\\nof truth upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you ever write to Sir Charles asking him to meet you?\" I continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Lyons flushed with anger again. \"Really, sir, this is a very\\r\\nextraordinary question.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I answer, certainly not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not on the very day of Sir Charles\\'s death?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was before me. Her\\r\\ndry lips could not speak the \"No\" which I saw rather than heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surely your memory deceives you,\" said I. \"I could even quote a passage\\r\\nof your letter. It ran \\'Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn\\r\\nthis letter, and be at the gate by ten o\\'clock.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought that she had fainted, but she recovered herself by a supreme\\r\\neffort.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is there no such thing as a gentleman?\" she gasped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do Sir Charles an injustice. He did burn the letter. But sometimes\\r\\na letter may be legible even when burned. You acknowledge now that you\\r\\nwrote it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I did write it,\" she cried, pouring out her soul in a torrent of\\r\\nwords. \"I did write it. Why should I deny it? I have no reason to be\\r\\nashamed of it. I wished him to help me. I believed that if I had an\\r\\ninterview I could gain his help, so I asked him to meet me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why at such an hour?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because I had only just learned that he was going to London next day\\r\\nand might be away for months. There were reasons why I could not get\\r\\nthere earlier.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the house?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor\\'s\\r\\nhouse?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what happened when you did get there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never went.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Lyons!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I swear it to you on all I hold sacred. I never went. Something\\r\\nintervened to prevent my going.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What was that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a private matter. I cannot tell it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You acknowledge then that you made an appointment with Sir Charles at\\r\\nthe very hour and place at which he met his death, but you deny that you\\r\\nkept the appointment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the truth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain and again I cross-questioned her, but I could never get past that\\r\\npoint.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Lyons,\" said I as I rose from this long and inconclusive\\r\\ninterview, \"you are taking a very great responsibility and putting\\r\\nyourself in a very false position by not making an absolutely clean\\r\\nbreast of all that you know. If I have to call in the aid of the police\\r\\nyou will find how seriously you are compromised. If your position is\\r\\ninnocent, why did you in the first instance deny having written to Sir\\r\\nCharles upon that date?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from it and\\r\\nthat I might find myself involved in a scandal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy your\\r\\nletter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you have read the letter you will know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not say that I had read all the letter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You quoted some of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I quoted the postscript. The letter had, as I said, been burned and it\\r\\nwas not all legible. I ask you once again why it was that you were so\\r\\npressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter which he received\\r\\non the day of his death.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The matter is a very private one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The more reason why you should avoid a public investigation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will tell you, then. If you have heard anything of my unhappy history\\r\\nyou will know that I made a rash marriage and had reason to regret it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard so much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom I abhor.\\r\\nThe law is upon his side, and every day I am faced by the possibility\\r\\nthat he may force me to live with him. At the time that I wrote this\\r\\nletter to Sir Charles I had learned that there was a prospect of\\r\\nmy regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met. It meant\\r\\neverything to me--peace of mind, happiness, self-respect--everything. I\\r\\nknew Sir Charles\\'s generosity, and I thought that if he heard the story\\r\\nfrom my own lips he would help me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then how is it that you did not go?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because I received help in the interval from another source.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why then, did you not write to Sir Charles and explain this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I should have done had I not seen his death in the paper next\\r\\nmorning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman\\'s story hung coherently together, and all my questions were\\r\\nunable to shake it. I could only check it by finding if she had, indeed,\\r\\ninstituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time\\r\\nof the tragedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been to\\r\\nBaskerville Hall if she really had been, for a trap would be necessary\\r\\nto take her there, and could not have returned to Coombe Tracey until\\r\\nthe early hours of the morning. Such an excursion could not be kept\\r\\nsecret. The probability was, therefore, that she was telling the truth,\\r\\nor, at least, a part of the truth. I came away baffled and disheartened.\\r\\nOnce again I had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across\\r\\nevery path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission. And yet\\r\\nthe more I thought of the lady\\'s face and of her manner the more I felt\\r\\nthat something was being held back from me. Why should she turn so pale?\\r\\nWhy should she fight against every admission until it was forced from\\r\\nher? Why should she have been so reticent at the time of the tragedy?\\r\\nSurely the explanation of all this could not be as innocent as she\\r\\nwould have me believe. For the moment I could proceed no farther in that\\r\\ndirection, but must turn back to that other clue which was to be sought\\r\\nfor among the stone huts upon the moor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that was a most vague direction. I realized it as I drove back\\r\\nand noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people.\\r\\nBarrymore\\'s only indication had been that the stranger lived in one of\\r\\nthese abandoned huts, and many hundreds of them are scattered throughout\\r\\nthe length and breadth of the moor. But I had my own experience for a\\r\\nguide since it had shown me the man himself standing upon the summit of\\r\\nthe Black Tor. That, then, should be the centre of my search. From there\\r\\nI should explore every hut upon the moor until I lighted upon the right\\r\\none. If this man were inside it I should find out from his own lips, at\\r\\nthe point of my revolver if necessary, who he was and why he had dogged\\r\\nus so long. He might slip away from us in the crowd of Regent Street,\\r\\nbut it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor. On the other\\r\\nhand, if I should find the hut and its tenant should not be within it I\\r\\nmust remain there, however long the vigil, until he returned. Holmes had\\r\\nmissed him in London. It would indeed be a triumph for me if I could run\\r\\nhim to earth where my master had failed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuck had been against us again and again in this inquiry, but now at\\r\\nlast it came to my aid. And the messenger of good fortune was none other\\r\\nthan Mr. Frankland, who was standing, gray-whiskered and red-faced,\\r\\noutside the gate of his garden, which opened on to the highroad along\\r\\nwhich I travelled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-day, Dr. Watson,\" cried he with unwonted good humour, \"you must\\r\\nreally give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass of wine and\\r\\nto congratulate me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after what I\\r\\nhad heard of his treatment of his daughter, but I was anxious to send\\r\\nPerkins and the wagonette home, and the opportunity was a good one. I\\r\\nalighted and sent a message to Sir Henry that I should walk over in time\\r\\nfor dinner. Then I followed Frankland into his dining-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a great day for me, sir--one of the red-letter days of my life,\"\\r\\nhe cried with many chuckles. \"I have brought off a double event. I mean\\r\\nto teach them in these parts that law is law, and that there is a man\\r\\nhere who does not fear to invoke it. I have established a right of way\\r\\nthrough the centre of old Middleton\\'s park, slap across it, sir, within\\r\\na hundred yards of his own front door. What do you think of that? We\\'ll\\r\\nteach these magnates that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights\\r\\nof the commoners, confound them! And I\\'ve closed the wood where the\\r\\nFernworthy folk used to picnic. These infernal people seem to think that\\r\\nthere are no rights of property, and that they can swarm where they like\\r\\nwith their papers and their bottles. Both cases decided, Dr. Watson, and\\r\\nboth in my favour. I haven\\'t had such a day since I had Sir John Morland\\r\\nfor trespass because he shot in his own warren.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How on earth did you do that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look it up in the books, sir. It will repay reading--Frankland v.\\r\\nMorland, Court of Queen\\'s Bench. It cost me 200 pounds, but I got my\\r\\nverdict.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did it do you any good?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None, sir, none. I am proud to say that I had no interest in the\\r\\nmatter. I act entirely from a sense of public duty. I have no doubt, for\\r\\nexample, that the Fernworthy people will burn me in effigy tonight.\\r\\nI told the police last time they did it that they should stop these\\r\\ndisgraceful exhibitions. The County Constabulary is in a scandalous\\r\\nstate, sir, and it has not afforded me the protection to which I am\\r\\nentitled. The case of Frankland v. Regina will bring the matter before\\r\\nthe attention of the public. I told them that they would have occasion\\r\\nto regret their treatment of me, and already my words have come true.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How so?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man put on a very knowing expression. \"Because I could tell them\\r\\nwhat they are dying to know; but nothing would induce me to help the\\r\\nrascals in any way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had been casting round for some excuse by which I could get away\\r\\nfrom his gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it. I had seen\\r\\nenough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any\\r\\nstrong sign of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some poaching case, no doubt?\" said I with an indifferent manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than that! What about\\r\\nthe convict on the moor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI stared. \"You don\\'t mean that you know where he is?\" said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I may not know exactly where he is, but I am quite sure that I could\\r\\nhelp the police to lay their hands on him. Has it never struck you that\\r\\nthe way to catch that man was to find out where he got his food and so\\r\\ntrace it to him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth. \"No\\r\\ndoubt,\" said I; \"but how do you know that he is anywhere upon the moor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know it because I have seen with my own eyes the messenger who takes\\r\\nhim his food.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy heart sank for Barrymore. It was a serious thing to be in the power\\r\\nof this spiteful old busybody. But his next remark took a weight from my\\r\\nmind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a child.\\r\\nI see him every day through my telescope upon the roof. He passes along\\r\\nthe same path at the same hour, and to whom should he be going except to\\r\\nthe convict?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere was luck indeed! And yet I suppressed all appearance of interest. A\\r\\nchild! Barrymore had said that our unknown was supplied by a boy. It was\\r\\non his track, and not upon the convict\\'s, that Frankland had stumbled.\\r\\nIf I could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt. But\\r\\nincredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of one of\\r\\nthe moorland shepherds taking out his father\\'s dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old autocrat.\\r\\nHis eyes looked malignantly at me, and his gray whiskers bristled like\\r\\nthose of an angry cat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, sir!\" said he, pointing out over the wide-stretching moor. \"Do\\r\\nyou see that Black Tor over yonder? Well, do you see the low hill beyond\\r\\nwith the thornbush upon it? It is the stoniest part of the whole moor.\\r\\nIs that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his station?\\r\\nYour suggestion, sir, is a most absurd one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI meekly answered that I had spoken without knowing all the facts. My\\r\\nsubmission pleased him and led him to further confidences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I come to an\\r\\nopinion. I have seen the boy again and again with his bundle. Every\\r\\nday, and sometimes twice a day, I have been able--but wait a moment,\\r\\nDr. Watson. Do my eyes deceive me, or is there at the present moment\\r\\nsomething moving upon that hillside?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark dot\\r\\nagainst the dull green and gray.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, sir, come!\" cried Frankland, rushing upstairs. \"You will see with\\r\\nyour own eyes and judge for yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod, stood upon\\r\\nthe flat leads of the house. Frankland clapped his eye to it and gave a\\r\\ncry of satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quick, Dr. Watson, quick, before he passes over the hill!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere he was, sure enough, a small urchin with a little bundle upon his\\r\\nshoulder, toiling slowly up the hill. When he reached the crest I saw\\r\\nthe ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue\\r\\nsky. He looked round him with a furtive and stealthy air, as one who\\r\\ndreads pursuit. Then he vanished over the hill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well! Am I right?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what the errand is even a county constable could guess. But not\\r\\none word shall they have from me, and I bind you to secrecy also, Dr.\\r\\nWatson. Not a word! You understand!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as you wish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have treated me shamefully--shamefully. When the facts come out in\\r\\nFrankland v. Regina I venture to think that a thrill of indignation will\\r\\nrun through the country. Nothing would induce me to help the police in\\r\\nany way. For all they cared it might have been me, instead of my effigy,\\r\\nwhich these rascals burned at the stake. Surely you are not going! You\\r\\nwill help me to empty the decanter in honour of this great occasion!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading him\\r\\nfrom his announced intention of walking home with me. I kept the road\\r\\nas long as his eye was on me, and then I struck off across the moor and\\r\\nmade for the stony hill over which the boy had disappeared. Everything\\r\\nwas working in my favour, and I swore that it should not be through lack\\r\\nof energy or perseverance that I should miss the chance which fortune\\r\\nhad thrown in my way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun was already sinking when I reached the summit of the hill, and\\r\\nthe long slopes beneath me were all golden-green on one side and gray\\r\\nshadow on the other. A haze lay low upon the farthest sky-line, out of\\r\\nwhich jutted the fantastic shapes of Belliver and Vixen Tor. Over the\\r\\nwide expanse there was no sound and no movement. One great gray bird, a\\r\\ngull or curlew, soared aloft in the blue heaven. He and I seemed to be\\r\\nthe only living things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert\\r\\nbeneath it. The barren scene, the sense of loneliness, and the mystery\\r\\nand urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart. The boy was\\r\\nnowhere to be seen. But down beneath me in a cleft of the hills there\\r\\nwas a circle of the old stone huts, and in the middle of them there\\r\\nwas one which retained sufficient roof to act as a screen against the\\r\\nweather. My heart leaped within me as I saw it. This must be the burrow\\r\\nwhere the stranger lurked. At last my foot was on the threshold of his\\r\\nhiding place--his secret was within my grasp.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I approached the hut, walking as warily as Stapleton would do when\\r\\nwith poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, I satisfied myself\\r\\nthat the place had indeed been used as a habitation. A vague pathway\\r\\namong the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a\\r\\ndoor. All was silent within. The unknown might be lurking there, or\\r\\nhe might be prowling on the moor. My nerves tingled with the sense of\\r\\nadventure. Throwing aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the butt\\r\\nof my revolver and, walking swiftly up to the door, I looked in. The\\r\\nplace was empty.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there were ample signs that I had not come upon a false scent. This\\r\\nwas certainly where the man lived. Some blankets rolled in a waterproof\\r\\nlay upon that very stone slab upon which Neolithic man had once\\r\\nslumbered. The ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate. Beside it\\r\\nlay some cooking utensils and a bucket half-full of water. A litter of\\r\\nempty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time, and I\\r\\nsaw, as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light, a pannikin and\\r\\na half-full bottle of spirits standing in the corner. In the middle of\\r\\nthe hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this stood\\r\\na small cloth bundle--the same, no doubt, which I had seen through the\\r\\ntelescope upon the shoulder of the boy. It contained a loaf of bread,\\r\\na tinned tongue, and two tins of preserved peaches. As I set it down\\r\\nagain, after having examined it, my heart leaped to see that beneath it\\r\\nthere lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it. I raised it, and this\\r\\nwas what I read, roughly scrawled in pencil: \"Dr. Watson has gone to\\r\\nCoombe Tracey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a minute I stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the\\r\\nmeaning of this curt message. It was I, then, and not Sir Henry, who was\\r\\nbeing dogged by this secret man. He had not followed me himself, but\\r\\nhe had set an agent--the boy, perhaps--upon my track, and this was his\\r\\nreport. Possibly I had taken no step since I had been upon the moor\\r\\nwhich had not been observed and reported. Always there was this feeling\\r\\nof an unseen force, a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and\\r\\ndelicacy, holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment\\r\\nthat one realized that one was indeed entangled in its meshes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there was one report there might be others, so I looked round the hut\\r\\nin search of them. There was no trace, however, of anything of the kind,\\r\\nnor could I discover any sign which might indicate the character or\\r\\nintentions of the man who lived in this singular place, save that he\\r\\nmust be of Spartan habits and cared little for the comforts of life.\\r\\nWhen I thought of the heavy rains and looked at the gaping roof I\\r\\nunderstood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept\\r\\nhim in that inhospitable abode. Was he our malignant enemy, or was he by\\r\\nchance our guardian angel? I swore that I would not leave the hut until\\r\\nI knew.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with scarlet\\r\\nand gold. Its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches by the distant\\r\\npools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire. There were the two towers\\r\\nof Baskerville Hall, and there a distant blur of smoke which marked the\\r\\nvillage of Grimpen. Between the two, behind the hill, was the house\\r\\nof the Stapletons. All was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden\\r\\nevening light, and yet as I looked at them my soul shared none of the\\r\\npeace of Nature but quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that\\r\\ninterview which every instant was bringing nearer. With tingling nerves\\r\\nbut a fixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited with\\r\\nsombre patience for the coming of its tenant.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then at last I heard him. Far away came the sharp clink of a boot\\r\\nstriking upon a stone. Then another and yet another, coming nearer and\\r\\nnearer. I shrank back into the darkest corner and cocked the pistol in\\r\\nmy pocket, determined not to discover myself until I had an opportunity\\r\\nof seeing something of the stranger. There was a long pause which showed\\r\\nthat he had stopped. Then once more the footsteps approached and a\\r\\nshadow fell across the opening of the hut.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a lovely evening, my dear Watson,\" said a well-known voice. \"I\\r\\nreally think that you will be more comfortable outside than in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 12. Death on the Moor\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe my ears.\\r\\nThen my senses and my voice came back to me, while a crushing weight\\r\\nof responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul. That\\r\\ncold, incisive, ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Holmes!\" I cried--\"Holmes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come out,\" said he, \"and please be careful with the revolver.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat upon a stone outside,\\r\\nhis gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished\\r\\nfeatures. He was thin and worn, but clear and alert, his keen face\\r\\nbronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind. In his tweed suit and\\r\\ncloth cap he looked like any other tourist upon the moor, and he had\\r\\ncontrived, with that catlike love of personal cleanliness which was one\\r\\nof his characteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linen\\r\\nas perfect as if he were in Baker Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never was more glad to see anyone in my life,\" said I as I wrung him\\r\\nby the hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or more astonished, eh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I must confess to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The surprise was not all on one side, I assure you. I had no idea that\\r\\nyou had found my occasional retreat, still less that you were inside it,\\r\\nuntil I was within twenty paces of the door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My footprint, I presume?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Watson, I fear that I could not undertake to recognize your\\r\\nfootprint amid all the footprints of the world. If you seriously desire\\r\\nto deceive me you must change your tobacconist; for when I see the stub\\r\\nof a cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I know that my friend\\r\\nWatson is in the neighbourhood. You will see it there beside the path.\\r\\nYou threw it down, no doubt, at that supreme moment when you charged\\r\\ninto the empty hut.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought as much--and knowing your admirable tenacity I was convinced\\r\\nthat you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach, waiting for the\\r\\ntenant to return. So you actually thought that I was the criminal?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excellent, Watson! And how did you localize me? You saw me, perhaps, on\\r\\nthe night of the convict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow the\\r\\nmoon to rise behind me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I saw you then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where to\\r\\nlook.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. I could not make it out\\r\\nwhen first I saw the light flashing upon the lens.\" He rose and peeped\\r\\ninto the hut. \"Ha, I see that Cartwright has brought up some supplies.\\r\\nWhat\\'s this paper? So you have been to Coombe Tracey, have you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To see Mrs. Laura Lyons?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well done! Our researches have evidently been running on parallel\\r\\nlines, and when we unite our results I expect we shall have a fairly\\r\\nfull knowledge of the case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed the\\r\\nresponsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my\\r\\nnerves. But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what have\\r\\nyou been doing? I thought that you were in Baker Street working out that\\r\\ncase of blackmailing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That was what I wished you to think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!\" I cried with some\\r\\nbitterness. \"I think that I have deserved better at your hands, Holmes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in many other\\r\\ncases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have seemed to play a\\r\\ntrick upon you. In truth, it was partly for your own sake that I did it,\\r\\nand it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to\\r\\ncome down and examine the matter for myself. Had I been with Sir Henry\\r\\nand you it is confident that my point of view would have been the\\r\\nsame as yours, and my presence would have warned our very formidable\\r\\nopponents to be on their guard. As it is, I have been able to get about\\r\\nas I could not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and\\r\\nI remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all my\\r\\nweight at a critical moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why keep me in the dark?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have led\\r\\nto my discovery. You would have wished to tell me something, or in your\\r\\nkindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other, and so an\\r\\nunnecessary risk would be run. I brought Cartwright down with me--you\\r\\nremember the little chap at the express office--and he has seen after\\r\\nmy simple wants: a loaf of bread and a clean collar. What does man want\\r\\nmore? He has given me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of\\r\\nfeet, and both have been invaluable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then my reports have all been wasted!\"--My voice trembled as I recalled\\r\\nthe pains and the pride with which I had composed them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I assure\\r\\nyou. I made excellent arrangements, and they are only delayed one day\\r\\nupon their way. I must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and\\r\\nthe intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult\\r\\ncase.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon\\r\\nme, but the warmth of Holmes\\'s praise drove my anger from my mind. I\\r\\nfelt also in my heart that he was right in what he said and that it was\\r\\nreally best for our purpose that I should not have known that he was\\r\\nupon the moor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s better,\" said he, seeing the shadow rise from my face. \"And\\r\\nnow tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyons--it was not\\r\\ndifficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone, for\\r\\nI am already aware that she is the one person in Coombe Tracey who might\\r\\nbe of service to us in the matter. In fact, if you had not gone today it\\r\\nis exceedingly probable that I should have gone tomorrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. The air had turned\\r\\nchill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. There, sitting together\\r\\nin the twilight, I told Holmes of my conversation with the lady. So\\r\\ninterested was he that I had to repeat some of it twice before he was\\r\\nsatisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is most important,\" said he when I had concluded. \"It fills up a\\r\\ngap which I had been unable to bridge in this most complex affair. You\\r\\nare aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists between this lady and\\r\\nthe man Stapleton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know of a close intimacy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There can be no doubt about the matter. They meet, they write, there\\r\\nis a complete understanding between them. Now, this puts a very powerful\\r\\nweapon into our hands. If I could only use it to detach his wife--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His wife?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am giving you some information now, in return for all that you have\\r\\ngiven me. The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is in reality\\r\\nhis wife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens, Holmes! Are you sure of what you say? How could he have\\r\\npermitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir Henry\\'s falling in love could do no harm to anyone except Sir\\r\\nHenry. He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make love to her,\\r\\nas you have yourself observed. I repeat that the lady is his wife and\\r\\nnot his sister.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why this elaborate deception?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to him in\\r\\nthe character of a free woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took shape and\\r\\ncentred upon the naturalist. In that impassive colourless man, with his\\r\\nstraw hat and his butterfly-net, I seemed to see something terrible--a\\r\\ncreature of infinite patience and craft, with a smiling face and a\\r\\nmurderous heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is he, then, who is our enemy--it is he who dogged us in London?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I read the riddle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the warning--it must have come from her!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shape of some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed, loomed\\r\\nthrough the darkness which had girt me so long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But are you sure of this, Holmes? How do you know that the woman is his\\r\\nwife?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of\\r\\nautobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I dare say\\r\\nhe has many a time regretted it since. He was once a schoolmaster in\\r\\nthe north of England. Now, there is no one more easy to trace than a\\r\\nschoolmaster. There are scholastic agencies by which one may identify\\r\\nany man who has been in the profession. A little investigation showed me\\r\\nthat a school had come to grief under atrocious circumstances, and that\\r\\nthe man who had owned it--the name was different--had disappeared with\\r\\nhis wife. The descriptions agreed. When I learned that the missing man\\r\\nwas devoted to entomology the identification was complete.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the shadows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If this woman is in truth his wife, where does Mrs. Laura Lyons come\\r\\nin?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a\\r\\nlight. Your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very\\r\\nmuch. I did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her\\r\\nhusband. In that case, regarding Stapleton as an unmarried man, she\\r\\ncounted no doubt upon becoming his wife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And when she is undeceived?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, then we may find the lady of service. It must be our first duty\\r\\nto see her--both of us--tomorrow. Don\\'t you think, Watson, that you are\\r\\naway from your charge rather long? Your place should be at Baskerville\\r\\nHall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had settled\\r\\nupon the moor. A few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One last question, Holmes,\" I said as I rose. \"Surely there is no need\\r\\nof secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning of it all? What is he\\r\\nafter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes\\'s voice sank as he answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is murder, Watson--refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder. Do not\\r\\nask me for particulars. My nets are closing upon him, even as his are\\r\\nupon Sir Henry, and with your help he is already almost at my mercy.\\r\\nThere is but one danger which can threaten us. It is that he should\\r\\nstrike before we are ready to do so. Another day--two at the most--and\\r\\nI have my case complete, but until then guard your charge as closely\\r\\nas ever a fond mother watched her ailing child. Your mission today has\\r\\njustified itself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his\\r\\nside. Hark!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA terrible scream--a prolonged yell of horror and anguish--burst out of\\r\\nthe silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the blood to ice in\\r\\nmy veins.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my God!\" I gasped. \"What is it? What does it mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic outline at\\r\\nthe door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head thrust forward,\\r\\nhis face peering into the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hush!\" he whispered. \"Hush!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had pealed out\\r\\nfrom somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it burst upon our ears,\\r\\nnearer, louder, more urgent than before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is it?\" Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of his voice\\r\\nthat he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul. \"Where is it, Watson?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There, I think.\" I pointed into the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, there!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the agonized cry swept through the silent night, louder and much\\r\\nnearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep, muttered\\r\\nrumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling like the low,\\r\\nconstant murmur of the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The hound!\" cried Holmes. \"Come, Watson, come! Great heavens, if we are\\r\\ntoo late!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed at his\\r\\nheels. But now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in\\r\\nfront of us there came one last despairing yell, and then a dull, heavy\\r\\nthud. We halted and listened. Not another sound broke the heavy silence\\r\\nof the windless night.\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted. He\\r\\nstamped his feet upon the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has beaten us, Watson. We are too late.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, surely not!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fool that I was to hold my hand. And you, Watson, see what comes of\\r\\nabandoning your charge! But, by Heaven, if the worst has happened we\\'ll\\r\\navenge him!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders, forcing\\r\\nour way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and rushing down slopes,\\r\\nheading always in the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come.\\r\\nAt every rise Holmes looked eagerly round him, but the shadows were\\r\\nthick upon the moor, and nothing moved upon its dreary face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you see anything?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, hark, what is that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA low moan had fallen upon our ears. There it was again upon our left!\\r\\nOn that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which overlooked\\r\\na stone-strewn slope. On its jagged face was spread-eagled some dark,\\r\\nirregular object. As we ran towards it the vague outline hardened into\\r\\na definite shape. It was a prostrate man face downward upon the ground,\\r\\nthe head doubled under him at a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded\\r\\nand the body hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault.\\r\\nSo grotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instant realize\\r\\nthat that moan had been the passing of his soul. Not a whisper, not a\\r\\nrustle, rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped. Holmes laid\\r\\nhis hand upon him and held it up again with an exclamation of horror.\\r\\nThe gleam of the match which he struck shone upon his clotted fingers\\r\\nand upon the ghastly pool which widened slowly from the crushed skull\\r\\nof the victim. And it shone upon something else which turned our hearts\\r\\nsick and faint within us--the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar ruddy tweed\\r\\nsuit--the very one which he had worn on the first morning that we had\\r\\nseen him in Baker Street. We caught the one clear glimpse of it, and\\r\\nthen the match flickered and went out, even as the hope had gone out\\r\\nof our souls. Holmes groaned, and his face glimmered white through the\\r\\ndarkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The brute! The brute!\" I cried with clenched hands. \"Oh Holmes, I shall\\r\\nnever forgive myself for having left him to his fate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am more to blame than you, Watson. In order to have my case well\\r\\nrounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of my client. It is\\r\\nthe greatest blow which has befallen me in my career. But how could I\\r\\nknow--how could I know--that he would risk his life alone upon the moor\\r\\nin the face of all my warnings?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That we should have heard his screams--my God, those screams!--and yet\\r\\nhave been unable to save him! Where is this brute of a hound which drove\\r\\nhim to his death? It may be lurking among these rocks at this instant.\\r\\nAnd Stapleton, where is he? He shall answer for this deed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He shall. I will see to that. Uncle and nephew have been murdered--the\\r\\none frightened to death by the very sight of a beast which he thought\\r\\nto be supernatural, the other driven to his end in his wild flight to\\r\\nescape from it. But now we have to prove the connection between the\\r\\nman and the beast. Save from what we heard, we cannot even swear to the\\r\\nexistence of the latter, since Sir Henry has evidently died from the\\r\\nfall. But, by heavens, cunning as he is, the fellow shall be in my power\\r\\nbefore another day is past!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body,\\r\\noverwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had brought\\r\\nall our long and weary labours to so piteous an end. Then as the moon\\r\\nrose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which our poor friend had\\r\\nfallen, and from the summit we gazed out over the shadowy moor, half\\r\\nsilver and half gloom. Far away, miles off, in the direction of Grimpen,\\r\\na single steady yellow light was shining. It could only come from the\\r\\nlonely abode of the Stapletons. With a bitter curse I shook my fist at\\r\\nit as I gazed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should we not seize him at once?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning to the last\\r\\ndegree. It is not what we know, but what we can prove. If we make one\\r\\nfalse move the villain may escape us yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can we do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There will be plenty for us to do tomorrow. Tonight we can only perform\\r\\nthe last offices to our poor friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether we made our way down the precipitous slope and approached the\\r\\nbody, black and clear against the silvered stones. The agony of those\\r\\ncontorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain and blurred my eyes with\\r\\ntears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must send for help, Holmes! We cannot carry him all the way to the\\r\\nHall. Good heavens, are you mad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had uttered a cry and bent over the body. Now he was dancing and\\r\\nlaughing and wringing my hand. Could this be my stern, self-contained\\r\\nfriend? These were hidden fires, indeed!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A beard! A beard! The man has a beard!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A beard?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is not the baronet--it is--why, it is my neighbour, the convict!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that dripping beard\\r\\nwas pointing up to the cold, clear moon. There could be no doubt about\\r\\nthe beetling forehead, the sunken animal eyes. It was indeed the same\\r\\nface which had glared upon me in the light of the candle from over the\\r\\nrock--the face of Selden, the criminal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen in an instant it was all clear to me. I remembered how the baronet\\r\\nhad told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to Barrymore. Barrymore\\r\\nhad passed it on in order to help Selden in his escape. Boots, shirt,\\r\\ncap--it was all Sir Henry\\'s. The tragedy was still black enough, but\\r\\nthis man had at least deserved death by the laws of his country. I told\\r\\nHolmes how the matter stood, my heart bubbling over with thankfulness\\r\\nand joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then the clothes have been the poor devil\\'s death,\" said he. \"It is\\r\\nclear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of\\r\\nSir Henry\\'s--the boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all\\r\\nprobability--and so ran this man down. There is one very singular thing,\\r\\nhowever: How came Selden, in the darkness, to know that the hound was on\\r\\nhis trail?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He heard him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this\\r\\nconvict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture\\r\\nby screaming wildly for help. By his cries he must have run a long way\\r\\nafter he knew the animal was on his track. How did he know?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that all our\\r\\nconjectures are correct--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I presume nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, why this hound should be loose tonight. I suppose that it\\r\\ndoes not always run loose upon the moor. Stapleton would not let it go\\r\\nunless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would be there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think that we\\r\\nshall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while mine may remain\\r\\nforever a mystery. The question now is, what shall we do with this poor\\r\\nwretch\\'s body? We cannot leave it here to the foxes and the ravens.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate\\r\\nwith the police.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly. I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far. Halloa,\\r\\nWatson, what\\'s this? It\\'s the man himself, by all that\\'s wonderful and\\r\\naudacious! Not a word to show your suspicions--not a word, or my plans\\r\\ncrumble to the ground.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red glow\\r\\nof a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish the dapper\\r\\nshape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. He stopped when he saw us, and\\r\\nthen came on again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, Dr. Watson, that\\'s not you, is it? You are the last man that I\\r\\nshould have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night. But,\\r\\ndear me, what\\'s this? Somebody hurt? Not--don\\'t tell me that it is our\\r\\nfriend Sir Henry!\" He hurried past me and stooped over the dead man. I\\r\\nheard a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who--who\\'s this?\" he stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme effort he had\\r\\novercome his amazement and his disappointment. He looked sharply from\\r\\nHolmes to me. \"Dear me! What a very shocking affair! How did he die?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks. My\\r\\nfriend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I heard a cry also. That was what brought me out. I was uneasy about\\r\\nSir Henry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why about Sir Henry in particular?\" I could not help asking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because I had suggested that he should come over. When he did not come\\r\\nI was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his safety when I\\r\\nheard cries upon the moor. By the way\"--his eyes darted again from my\\r\\nface to Holmes\\'s--\"did you hear anything else besides a cry?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Holmes; \"did you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom\\r\\nhound, and so on. It is said to be heard at night upon the moor. I was\\r\\nwondering if there were any evidence of such a sound tonight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We heard nothing of the kind,\" said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what is your theory of this poor fellow\\'s death?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his head.\\r\\nHe has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over\\r\\nhere and broken his neck.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That seems the most reasonable theory,\" said Stapleton, and he gave a\\r\\nsigh which I took to indicate his relief. \"What do you think about it,\\r\\nMr. Sherlock Holmes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend bowed his compliments. \"You are quick at identification,\" said\\r\\nhe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came down.\\r\\nYou are in time to see a tragedy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend\\'s explanation will cover\\r\\nthe facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to London with me\\r\\ntomorrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you return tomorrow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is my intention.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have\\r\\npuzzled us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One cannot always have the success for which one hopes. An investigator\\r\\nneeds facts and not legends or rumours. It has not been a satisfactory\\r\\ncase.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner. Stapleton\\r\\nstill looked hard at him. Then he turned to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it would\\r\\ngive my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified in doing it.\\r\\nI think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until\\r\\nmorning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton\\'s offer of hospitality,\\r\\nHolmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving the naturalist to\\r\\nreturn alone. Looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the\\r\\nbroad moor, and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered slope\\r\\nwhich showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly to his\\r\\nend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 13. Fixing the Nets\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'re at close grips at last,\" said Holmes as we walked together across\\r\\nthe moor. \"What a nerve the fellow has! How he pulled himself together\\r\\nin the face of what must have been a paralyzing shock when he found that\\r\\nthe wrong man had fallen a victim to his plot. I told you in London,\\r\\nWatson, and I tell you now again, that we have never had a foeman more\\r\\nworthy of our steel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry that he has seen you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so was I at first. But there was no getting out of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows\\r\\nyou are here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to desperate\\r\\nmeasures at once. Like most clever criminals, he may be too confident in\\r\\nhis own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should we not arrest him at once?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Watson, you were born to be a man of action. Your instinct is\\r\\nalways to do something energetic. But supposing, for argument\\'s sake,\\r\\nthat we had him arrested tonight, what on earth the better off should\\r\\nwe be for that? We could prove nothing against him. There\\'s the devilish\\r\\ncunning of it! If he were acting through a human agent we could get some\\r\\nevidence, but if we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it\\r\\nwould not help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surely we have a case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not a shadow of one--only surmise and conjecture. We should be laughed\\r\\nout of court if we came with such a story and such evidence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is Sir Charles\\'s death.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Found dead without a mark upon him. You and I know that he died of\\r\\nsheer fright, and we know also what frightened him, but how are we to\\r\\nget twelve stolid jurymen to know it? What signs are there of a hound?\\r\\nWhere are the marks of its fangs? Of course we know that a hound does\\r\\nnot bite a dead body and that Sir Charles was dead before ever the\\r\\nbrute overtook him. But we have to prove all this, and we are not in a\\r\\nposition to do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, tonight?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are not much better off tonight. Again, there was no direct\\r\\nconnection between the hound and the man\\'s death. We never saw the\\r\\nhound. We heard it, but we could not prove that it was running upon this\\r\\nman\\'s trail. There is a complete absence of motive. No, my dear fellow;\\r\\nwe must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present,\\r\\nand that it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish\\r\\none.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how do you propose to do so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when the\\r\\nposition of affairs is made clear to her. And I have my own plan as\\r\\nwell. Sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof; but I hope before the\\r\\nday is past to have the upper hand at last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in thought,\\r\\nas far as the Baskerville gates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you coming up?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; I see no reason for further concealment. But one last word,\\r\\nWatson. Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry. Let him think that\\r\\nSelden\\'s death was as Stapleton would have us believe. He will have a\\r\\nbetter nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo tomorrow,\\r\\nwhen he is engaged, if I remember your report aright, to dine with these\\r\\npeople.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so am I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. That will be easily\\r\\narranged. And now, if we are too late for dinner, I think that we are\\r\\nboth ready for our suppers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes, for he\\r\\nhad for some days been expecting that recent events would bring him down\\r\\nfrom London. He did raise his eyebrows, however, when he found that my\\r\\nfriend had neither any luggage nor any explanations for its absence.\\r\\nBetween us we soon supplied his wants, and then over a belated supper\\r\\nwe explained to the baronet as much of our experience as it seemed\\r\\ndesirable that he should know. But first I had the unpleasant duty of\\r\\nbreaking the news to Barrymore and his wife. To him it may have been an\\r\\nunmitigated relief, but she wept bitterly in her apron. To all the world\\r\\nhe was the man of violence, half animal and half demon; but to her he\\r\\nalways remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood, the child who\\r\\nhad clung to her hand. Evil indeed is the man who has not one woman to\\r\\nmourn him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve been moping in the house all day since Watson went off in the\\r\\nmorning,\" said the baronet. \"I guess I should have some credit, for I\\r\\nhave kept my promise. If I hadn\\'t sworn not to go about alone I might\\r\\nhave had a more lively evening, for I had a message from Stapleton\\r\\nasking me over there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening,\" said\\r\\nHolmes drily. \"By the way, I don\\'t suppose you appreciate that we have\\r\\nbeen mourning over you as having broken your neck?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Henry opened his eyes. \"How was that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. I fear your servant who\\r\\ngave them to him may get into trouble with the police.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is unlikely. There was no mark on any of them, as far as I know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s lucky for him--in fact, it\\'s lucky for all of you, since you are\\r\\nall on the wrong side of the law in this matter. I am not sure that as\\r\\na conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest the whole\\r\\nhousehold. Watson\\'s reports are most incriminating documents.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how about the case?\" asked the baronet. \"Have you made anything out\\r\\nof the tangle? I don\\'t know that Watson and I are much the wiser since\\r\\nwe came down.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that I shall be in a position to make the situation rather more\\r\\nclear to you before long. It has been an exceedingly difficult and most\\r\\ncomplicated business. There are several points upon which we still want\\r\\nlight--but it is coming all the same.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ve had one experience, as Watson has no doubt told you. We heard the\\r\\nhound on the moor, so I can swear that it is not all empty superstition.\\r\\nI had something to do with dogs when I was out West, and I know one when\\r\\nI hear one. If you can muzzle that one and put him on a chain I\\'ll be\\r\\nready to swear you are the greatest detective of all time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will give me\\r\\nyour help.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever you tell me to do I will do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good; and I will ask you also to do it blindly, without always\\r\\nasking the reason.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as you like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you will do this I think the chances are that our little problem\\r\\nwill soon be solved. I have no doubt--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the air. The\\r\\nlamp beat upon his face, and so intent was it and so still that it might\\r\\nhave been that of a clear-cut classical statue, a personification of\\r\\nalertness and expectation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it?\" we both cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could see as he looked down that he was repressing some internal\\r\\nemotion. His features were still composed, but his eyes shone with\\r\\namused exultation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excuse the admiration of a connoisseur,\" said he as he waved his hand\\r\\ntowards the line of portraits which covered the opposite wall. \"Watson\\r\\nwon\\'t allow that I know anything of art but that is mere jealousy\\r\\nbecause our views upon the subject differ. Now, these are a really very\\r\\nfine series of portraits.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'m glad to hear you say so,\" said Sir Henry, glancing with some\\r\\nsurprise at my friend. \"I don\\'t pretend to know much about these things,\\r\\nand I\\'d be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture. I\\r\\ndidn\\'t know that you found time for such things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know what is good when I see it, and I see it now. That\\'s a Kneller,\\r\\nI\\'ll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and the stout\\r\\ngentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds. They are all family\\r\\nportraits, I presume?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Every one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know the names?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Barrymore has been coaching me in them, and I think I can say my\\r\\nlessons fairly well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is the gentleman with the telescope?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney in the West\\r\\nIndies. The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is Sir William\\r\\nBaskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the House of Commons\\r\\nunder Pitt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this Cavalier opposite to me--the one with the black velvet and the\\r\\nlace?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, you have a right to know about him. That is the cause of all the\\r\\nmischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of the Baskervilles.\\r\\nWe\\'re not likely to forget him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me!\" said Holmes, \"he seems a quiet, meek-mannered man enough, but\\r\\nI dare say that there was a lurking devil in his eyes. I had pictured\\r\\nhim as a more robust and ruffianly person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the date,\\r\\n1647, are on the back of the canvas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer seemed to\\r\\nhave a fascination for him, and his eyes were continually fixed upon it\\r\\nduring supper. It was not until later, when Sir Henry had gone to his\\r\\nroom, that I was able to follow the trend of his thoughts. He led me\\r\\nback into the banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand, and he\\r\\nheld it up against the time-stained portrait on the wall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you see anything there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the white lace\\r\\ncollar, and the straight, severe face which was framed between them. It\\r\\nwas not a brutal countenance, but it was prim, hard, and stern, with a\\r\\nfirm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly intolerant eye.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it like anyone you know?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is something of Sir Henry about the jaw.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just a suggestion, perhaps. But wait an instant!\" He stood upon a\\r\\nchair, and, holding up the light in his left hand, he curved his right\\r\\narm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens!\" I cried in amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha, you see it now. My eyes have been trained to examine faces and not\\r\\ntheir trimmings. It is the first quality of a criminal investigator that\\r\\nhe should see through a disguise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But this is marvellous. It might be his portrait.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it is an interesting instance of a throwback, which appears to be\\r\\nboth physical and spiritual. A study of family portraits is enough\\r\\nto convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation. The fellow is a\\r\\nBaskerville--that is evident.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With designs upon the succession.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly. This chance of the picture has supplied us with one of our\\r\\nmost obvious missing links. We have him, Watson, we have him, and I dare\\r\\nswear that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering in our net as\\r\\nhelpless as one of his own butterflies. A pin, a cork, and a card, and\\r\\nwe add him to the Baker Street collection!\" He burst into one of his\\r\\nrare fits of laughter as he turned away from the picture. I have not\\r\\nheard him laugh often, and it has always boded ill to somebody.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier still, for\\r\\nI saw him as I dressed, coming up the drive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, we should have a full day today,\" he remarked, and he rubbed his\\r\\nhands with the joy of action. \"The nets are all in place, and the drag\\r\\nis about to begin. We\\'ll know before the day is out whether we have\\r\\ncaught our big, leanjawed pike, or whether he has got through the\\r\\nmeshes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you been on the moor already?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the death of\\r\\nSelden. I think I can promise that none of you will be troubled in the\\r\\nmatter. And I have also communicated with my faithful Cartwright, who\\r\\nwould certainly have pined away at the door of my hut, as a dog does at\\r\\nhis master\\'s grave, if I had not set his mind at rest about my safety.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the next move?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To see Sir Henry. Ah, here he is!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-morning, Holmes,\" said the baronet. \"You look like a general who\\r\\nis planning a battle with his chief of the staff.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the exact situation. Watson was asking for orders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so do I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good. You are engaged, as I understand, to dine with our friends\\r\\nthe Stapletons tonight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope that you will come also. They are very hospitable people, and I\\r\\nam sure that they would be very glad to see you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I fear that Watson and I must go to London.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To London?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I think that we should be more useful there at the present\\r\\njuncture.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe baronet\\'s face perceptibly lengthened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hoped that you were going to see me through this business. The Hall\\r\\nand the moor are not very pleasant places when one is alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what I tell\\r\\nyou. You can tell your friends that we should have been happy to have\\r\\ncome with you, but that urgent business required us to be in town. We\\r\\nhope very soon to return to Devonshire. Will you remember to give them\\r\\nthat message?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you insist upon it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is no alternative, I assure you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw by the baronet\\'s clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by what he\\r\\nregarded as our desertion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When do you desire to go?\" he asked coldly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Immediately after breakfast. We will drive in to Coombe Tracey, but\\r\\nWatson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come back to you.\\r\\nWatson, you will send a note to Stapleton to tell him that you regret\\r\\nthat you cannot come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a good mind to go to London with you,\" said the baronet. \"Why\\r\\nshould I stay here alone?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because it is your post of duty. Because you gave me your word that you\\r\\nwould do as you were told, and I tell you to stay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right, then, I\\'ll stay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One more direction! I wish you to drive to Merripit House. Send back\\r\\nyour trap, however, and let them know that you intend to walk home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To walk across the moor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not to\\r\\ndo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This time you may do it with safety. If I had not every confidence in\\r\\nyour nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but it is essential that\\r\\nyou should do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I will do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction\\r\\nsave along the straight path which leads from Merripit House to the\\r\\nGrimpen Road, and is your natural way home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will do just what you say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good. I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as\\r\\npossible, so as to reach London in the afternoon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was much astounded by this programme, though I remembered that Holmes\\r\\nhad said to Stapleton on the night before that his visit would terminate\\r\\nnext day. It had not crossed my mind however, that he would wish me to\\r\\ngo with him, nor could I understand how we could both be absent at a\\r\\nmoment which he himself declared to be critical. There was nothing for\\r\\nit, however, but implicit obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful\\r\\nfriend, and a couple of hours afterwards we were at the station of\\r\\nCoombe Tracey and had dispatched the trap upon its return journey. A\\r\\nsmall boy was waiting upon the platform.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Any orders, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will take this train to town, Cartwright. The moment you arrive you\\r\\nwill send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my name, to say that if he\\r\\nfinds the pocketbook which I have dropped he is to send it by registered\\r\\npost to Baker Street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And ask at the station office if there is a message for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy returned with a telegram, which Holmes handed to me. It ran:\\r\\n\\r\\nWire received. Coming down with unsigned warrant. Arrive five-forty.\\r\\nLestrade.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is in answer to mine of this morning. He is the best of the\\r\\nprofessionals, I think, and we may need his assistance. Now, Watson, I\\r\\nthink that we cannot employ our time better than by calling upon your\\r\\nacquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. He would use the\\r\\nbaronet in order to convince the Stapletons that we were really gone,\\r\\nwhile we should actually return at the instant when we were likely to\\r\\nbe needed. That telegram from London, if mentioned by Sir Henry to the\\r\\nStapletons, must remove the last suspicions from their minds. Already I\\r\\nseemed to see our nets drawing closer around that leanjawed pike.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened his\\r\\ninterview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the\\r\\nlate Sir Charles Baskerville,\" said he. \"My friend here, Dr. Watson,\\r\\nhas informed me of what you have communicated, and also of what you have\\r\\nwithheld in connection with that matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What have I withheld?\" she asked defiantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have confessed that you asked Sir Charles to be at the gate at ten\\r\\no\\'clock. We know that that was the place and hour of his death. You have\\r\\nwithheld what the connection is between these events.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is no connection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one. But\\r\\nI think that we shall succeed in establishing a connection, after all. I\\r\\nwish to be perfectly frank with you, Mrs. Lyons. We regard this case as\\r\\none of murder, and the evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr.\\r\\nStapleton but his wife as well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lady sprang from her chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His wife!\" she cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The fact is no longer a secret. The person who has passed for his\\r\\nsister is really his wife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands were grasping the arms of her\\r\\nchair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white with the pressure\\r\\nof her grip.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His wife!\" she said again. \"His wife! He is not a married man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Prove it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can do so--!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have come prepared to do so,\" said Holmes, drawing several papers\\r\\nfrom his pocket. \"Here is a photograph of the couple taken in York four\\r\\nyears ago. It is indorsed \\'Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,\\' but you will have no\\r\\ndifficulty in recognizing him, and her also, if you know her by sight.\\r\\nHere are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Vandeleur, who at that time kept St. Oliver\\'s private school. Read\\r\\nthem and see if you can doubt the identity of these people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe glanced at them, and then looked up at us with the set, rigid face\\r\\nof a desperate woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Holmes,\" she said, \"this man had offered me marriage on condition\\r\\nthat I could get a divorce from my husband. He has lied to me, the\\r\\nvillain, in every conceivable way. Not one word of truth has he ever\\r\\ntold me. And why--why? I imagined that all was for my own sake. But now\\r\\nI see that I was never anything but a tool in his hands. Why should I\\r\\npreserve faith with him who never kept any with me? Why should I try to\\r\\nshield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts? Ask me what you\\r\\nlike, and there is nothing which I shall hold back. One thing I swear\\r\\nto you, and that is that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed of any\\r\\nharm to the old gentleman, who had been my kindest friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I entirely believe you, madam,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"The recital of\\r\\nthese events must be very painful to you, and perhaps it will make it\\r\\neasier if I tell you what occurred, and you can check me if I make any\\r\\nmaterial mistake. The sending of this letter was suggested to you by\\r\\nStapleton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He dictated it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive help from\\r\\nSir Charles for the legal expenses connected with your divorce?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from keeping\\r\\nthe appointment?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He told me that it would hurt his self-respect that any other man\\r\\nshould find the money for such an object, and that though he was a poor\\r\\nman himself he would devote his last penny to removing the obstacles\\r\\nwhich divided us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He appears to be a very consistent character. And then you heard\\r\\nnothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with Sir\\r\\nCharles?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He did. He said that the death was a very mysterious one, and that I\\r\\nshould certainly be suspected if the facts came out. He frightened me\\r\\ninto remaining silent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite so. But you had your suspicions?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated and looked down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knew him,\" she said. \"But if he had kept faith with me I should\\r\\nalways have done so with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape,\" said\\r\\nSherlock Holmes. \"You have had him in your power and he knew it, and yet\\r\\nyou are alive. You have been walking for some months very near to the\\r\\nedge of a precipice. We must wish you good-morning now, Mrs. Lyons, and\\r\\nit is probable that you will very shortly hear from us again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty thins\\r\\naway in front of us,\" said Holmes as we stood waiting for the arrival of\\r\\nthe express from town. \"I shall soon be in the position of being able\\r\\nto put into a single connected narrative one of the most singular\\r\\nand sensational crimes of modern times. Students of criminology will\\r\\nremember the analogous incidents in Godno, in Little Russia, in the year\\r\\n\\'66, and of course there are the Anderson murders in North Carolina, but\\r\\nthis case possesses some features which are entirely its own. Even now\\r\\nwe have no clear case against this very wily man. But I shall be very\\r\\nmuch surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this\\r\\nnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe London express came roaring into the station, and a small, wiry\\r\\nbulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriage. We all three\\r\\nshook hands, and I saw at once from the reverential way in which\\r\\nLestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since\\r\\nthe days when they had first worked together. I could well remember\\r\\nthe scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then to excite in the\\r\\npractical man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anything good?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The biggest thing for years,\" said Holmes. \"We have two hours before\\r\\nwe need think of starting. I think we might employ it in getting some\\r\\ndinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the London fog out of your\\r\\nthroat by giving you a breath of the pure night air of Dartmoor. Never\\r\\nbeen there? Ah, well, I don\\'t suppose you will forget your first visit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 14. The Hound of the Baskervilles\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of Sherlock Holmes\\'s defects--if, indeed, one may call it a\\r\\ndefect--was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans\\r\\nto any other person until the instant of their fulfilment. Partly it\\r\\ncame no doubt from his own masterful nature, which loved to dominate and\\r\\nsurprise those who were around him. Partly also from his professional\\r\\ncaution, which urged him never to take any chances. The result, however,\\r\\nwas very trying for those who were acting as his agents and assistants.\\r\\nI had often suffered under it, but never more so than during that long\\r\\ndrive in the darkness. The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we\\r\\nwere about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing,\\r\\nand I could only surmise what his course of action would be. My nerves\\r\\nthrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our faces and\\r\\nthe dark, void spaces on either side of the narrow road told me that we\\r\\nwere back upon the moor once again. Every stride of the horses and every\\r\\nturn of the wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of the hired\\r\\nwagonette, so that we were forced to talk of trivial matters when our\\r\\nnerves were tense with emotion and anticipation. It was a relief to me,\\r\\nafter that unnatural restraint, when we at last passed Frankland\\'s\\r\\nhouse and knew that we were drawing near to the Hall and to the scene\\r\\nof action. We did not drive up to the door but got down near the gate of\\r\\nthe avenue. The wagonette was paid off and ordered to return to Coombe\\r\\nTracey forthwith, while we started to walk to Merripit House.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you armed, Lestrade?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little detective smiled. \"As long as I have my trousers I have a\\r\\nhip-pocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have something in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good! My friend and I are also ready for emergencies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re mighty close about this affair, Mr. Holmes. What\\'s the game\\r\\nnow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A waiting game.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My word, it does not seem a very cheerful place,\" said the detective\\r\\nwith a shiver, glancing round him at the gloomy slopes of the hill and\\r\\nat the huge lake of fog which lay over the Grimpen Mire. \"I see the\\r\\nlights of a house ahead of us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is Merripit House and the end of our journey. I must request you\\r\\nto walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the house,\\r\\nbut Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards from it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This will do,\" said he. \"These rocks upon the right make an admirable\\r\\nscreen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are to wait here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get into this hollow,\\r\\nLestrade. You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson? Can you\\r\\ntell the position of the rooms? What are those latticed windows at this\\r\\nend?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think they are the kitchen windows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the one beyond, which shines so brightly?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is certainly the dining-room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The blinds are up. You know the lie of the land best. Creep forward\\r\\nquietly and see what they are doing--but for heaven\\'s sake don\\'t let\\r\\nthem know that they are watched!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which surrounded\\r\\nthe stunted orchard. Creeping in its shadow I reached a point whence I\\r\\ncould look straight through the uncurtained window.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were only two men in the room, Sir Henry and Stapleton. They sat\\r\\nwith their profiles towards me on either side of the round table. Both\\r\\nof them were smoking cigars, and coffee and wine were in front of them.\\r\\nStapleton was talking with animation, but the baronet looked pale and\\r\\ndistrait. Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened\\r\\nmoor was weighing heavily upon his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room, while Sir Henry\\r\\nfilled his glass again and leaned back in his chair, puffing at his\\r\\ncigar. I heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boots upon\\r\\ngravel. The steps passed along the path on the other side of the wall\\r\\nunder which I crouched. Looking over, I saw the naturalist pause at the\\r\\ndoor of an out-house in the corner of the orchard. A key turned in\\r\\na lock, and as he passed in there was a curious scuffling noise from\\r\\nwithin. He was only a minute or so inside, and then I heard the key turn\\r\\nonce more and he passed me and reentered the house. I saw him rejoin his\\r\\nguest, and I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to\\r\\ntell them what I had seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?\" Holmes asked when I had\\r\\nfinished my report.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other room\\r\\nexcept the kitchen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot think where she is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense, white\\r\\nfog. It was drifting slowly in our direction and banked itself up like a\\r\\nwall on that side of us, low but thick and well defined. The moon shone\\r\\non it, and it looked like a great shimmering ice-field, with the heads\\r\\nof the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface. Holmes\\'s face\\r\\nwas turned towards it, and he muttered impatiently as he watched its\\r\\nsluggish drift.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s moving towards us, Watson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is that serious?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very serious, indeed--the one thing upon earth which could have\\r\\ndisarranged my plans. He can\\'t be very long, now. It is already ten\\r\\no\\'clock. Our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out\\r\\nbefore the fog is over the path.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night was clear and fine above us. The stars shone cold and bright,\\r\\nwhile a half-moon bathed the whole scene in a soft, uncertain light.\\r\\nBefore us lay the dark bulk of the house, its serrated roof and\\r\\nbristling chimneys hard outlined against the silver-spangled sky. Broad\\r\\nbars of golden light from the lower windows stretched across the orchard\\r\\nand the moor. One of them was suddenly shut off. The servants had left\\r\\nthe kitchen. There only remained the lamp in the dining-room where the\\r\\ntwo men, the murderous host and the unconscious guest, still chatted\\r\\nover their cigars.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery minute that white woolly plain which covered one-half of the moor\\r\\nwas drifting closer and closer to the house. Already the first thin\\r\\nwisps of it were curling across the golden square of the lighted window.\\r\\nThe farther wall of the orchard was already invisible, and the trees\\r\\nwere standing out of a swirl of white vapour. As we watched it the\\r\\nfog-wreaths came crawling round both corners of the house and rolled\\r\\nslowly into one dense bank on which the upper floor and the roof\\r\\nfloated like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea. Holmes struck his hand\\r\\npassionately upon the rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his\\r\\nimpatience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he isn\\'t out in a quarter of an hour the path will be covered. In\\r\\nhalf an hour we won\\'t be able to see our hands in front of us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall we move farther back upon higher ground?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I think it would be as well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were\\r\\nhalf a mile from the house, and still that dense white sea, with the\\r\\nmoon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and inexorably on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are going too far,\" said Holmes. \"We dare not take the chance of his\\r\\nbeing overtaken before he can reach us. At all costs we must hold our\\r\\nground where we are.\" He dropped on his knees and clapped his ear to the\\r\\nground. \"Thank God, I think that I hear him coming.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor. Crouching among\\r\\nthe stones we stared intently at the silver-tipped bank in front of us.\\r\\nThe steps grew louder, and through the fog, as through a curtain, there\\r\\nstepped the man whom we were awaiting. He looked round him in surprise\\r\\nas he emerged into the clear, starlit night. Then he came swiftly along\\r\\nthe path, passed close to where we lay, and went on up the long slope\\r\\nbehind us. As he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder,\\r\\nlike a man who is ill at ease.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hist!\" cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click of a cocking pistol.\\r\\n\"Look out! It\\'s coming!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from somewhere in the heart\\r\\nof that crawling bank. The cloud was within fifty yards of where we lay,\\r\\nand we glared at it, all three, uncertain what horror was about to break\\r\\nfrom the heart of it. I was at Holmes\\'s elbow, and I glanced for an\\r\\ninstant at his face. It was pale and exultant, his eyes shining brightly\\r\\nin the moonlight. But suddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed\\r\\nstare, and his lips parted in amazement. At the same instant Lestrade\\r\\ngave a yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground.\\r\\nI sprang to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mind paralyzed\\r\\nby the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadows of\\r\\nthe fog. A hound it was, an enormous coal-black hound, but not such a\\r\\nhound as mortal eyes have ever seen. Fire burst from its open mouth, its\\r\\neyes glowed with a smouldering glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap\\r\\nwere outlined in flickering flame. Never in the delirious dream of\\r\\na disordered brain could anything more savage, more appalling, more\\r\\nhellish be conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke\\r\\nupon us out of the wall of fog.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the track,\\r\\nfollowing hard upon the footsteps of our friend. So paralyzed were we by\\r\\nthe apparition that we allowed him to pass before we had recovered our\\r\\nnerve. Then Holmes and I both fired together, and the creature gave a\\r\\nhideous howl, which showed that one at least had hit him. He did not\\r\\npause, however, but bounded onward. Far away on the path we saw Sir\\r\\nHenry looking back, his face white in the moonlight, his hands raised in\\r\\nhorror, glaring helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him\\r\\ndown. But that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the\\r\\nwinds. If he was vulnerable he was mortal, and if we could wound him we\\r\\ncould kill him. Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ran that night. I\\r\\nam reckoned fleet of foot, but he outpaced me as much as I outpaced the\\r\\nlittle professional. In front of us as we flew up the track we heard\\r\\nscream after scream from Sir Henry and the deep roar of the hound. I was\\r\\nin time to see the beast spring upon its victim, hurl him to the ground,\\r\\nand worry at his throat. But the next instant Holmes had emptied five\\r\\nbarrels of his revolver into the creature\\'s flank. With a last howl of\\r\\nagony and a vicious snap in the air, it rolled upon its back, four feet\\r\\npawing furiously, and then fell limp upon its side. I stooped, panting,\\r\\nand pressed my pistol to the dreadful, shimmering head, but it was\\r\\nuseless to press the trigger. The giant hound was dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen. We tore away his collar,\\r\\nand Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw that there was\\r\\nno sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in time. Already our\\r\\nfriend\\'s eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to move. Lestrade\\r\\nthrust his brandy-flask between the baronet\\'s teeth, and two frightened\\r\\neyes were looking up at us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My God!\" he whispered. \"What was it? What, in heaven\\'s name, was it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s dead, whatever it is,\" said Holmes. \"We\\'ve laid the family ghost\\r\\nonce and forever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was lying\\r\\nstretched before us. It was not a pure bloodhound and it was not a pure\\r\\nmastiff; but it appeared to be a combination of the two--gaunt, savage,\\r\\nand as large as a small lioness. Even now in the stillness of death,\\r\\nthe huge jaws seemed to be dripping with a bluish flame and the small,\\r\\ndeep-set, cruel eyes were ringed with fire. I placed my hand upon the\\r\\nglowing muzzle, and as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and\\r\\ngleamed in the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Phosphorus,\" I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A cunning preparation of it,\" said Holmes, sniffing at the dead animal.\\r\\n\"There is no smell which might have interfered with his power of scent.\\r\\nWe owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, for having exposed you to this\\r\\nfright. I was prepared for a hound, but not for such a creature as this.\\r\\nAnd the fog gave us little time to receive him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have saved my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Having first endangered it. Are you strong enough to stand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Give me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready for\\r\\nanything. So! Now, if you will help me up. What do you propose to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To leave you here. You are not fit for further adventures tonight. If\\r\\nyou will wait, one or other of us will go back with you to the Hall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tried to stagger to his feet; but he was still ghastly pale and\\r\\ntrembling in every limb. We helped him to a rock, where he sat shivering\\r\\nwith his face buried in his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must leave you now,\" said Holmes. \"The rest of our work must be\\r\\ndone, and every moment is of importance. We have our case, and now we\\r\\nonly want our man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a thousand to one against our finding him at the house,\" he\\r\\ncontinued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path. \"Those shots\\r\\nmust have told him that the game was up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We were some distance off, and this fog may have deadened them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He followed the hound to call him off--of that you may be certain. No,\\r\\nno, he\\'s gone by this time! But we\\'ll search the house and make sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe front door was open, so we rushed in and hurried from room to\\r\\nroom to the amazement of a doddering old manservant, who met us in the\\r\\npassage. There was no light save in the dining-room, but Holmes caught\\r\\nup the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored. No sign could we\\r\\nsee of the man whom we were chasing. On the upper floor, however, one of\\r\\nthe bedroom doors was locked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s someone in here,\" cried Lestrade. \"I can hear a movement. Open\\r\\nthis door!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA faint moaning and rustling came from within. Holmes struck the door\\r\\njust over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew open. Pistol in\\r\\nhand, we all three rushed into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain\\r\\nwhom we expected to see. Instead we were faced by an object so strange\\r\\nand so unexpected that we stood for a moment staring at it in amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room had been fashioned into a small museum, and the walls were\\r\\nlined by a number of glass-topped cases full of that collection of\\r\\nbutterflies and moths the formation of which had been the relaxation of\\r\\nthis complex and dangerous man. In the centre of this room there was an\\r\\nupright beam, which had been placed at some period as a support for the\\r\\nold worm-eaten baulk of timber which spanned the roof. To this post a\\r\\nfigure was tied, so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been\\r\\nused to secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it\\r\\nwas that of a man or a woman. One towel passed round the throat and was\\r\\nsecured at the back of the pillar. Another covered the lower part of\\r\\nthe face, and over it two dark eyes--eyes full of grief and shame and a\\r\\ndreadful questioning--stared back at us. In a minute we had torn off\\r\\nthe gag, unswathed the bonds, and Mrs. Stapleton sank upon the floor in\\r\\nfront of us. As her beautiful head fell upon her chest I saw the clear\\r\\nred weal of a whiplash across her neck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The brute!\" cried Holmes. \"Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle! Put her\\r\\nin the chair! She has fainted from ill-usage and exhaustion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe opened her eyes again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is he safe?\" she asked. \"Has he escaped?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He cannot escape us, madam.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, I did not mean my husband. Sir Henry? Is he safe?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the hound?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is dead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe gave a long sigh of satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank God! Thank God! Oh, this villain! See how he has treated me!\"\\r\\nShe shot her arms out from her sleeves, and we saw with horror that they\\r\\nwere all mottled with bruises. \"But this is nothing--nothing! It is my\\r\\nmind and soul that he has tortured and defiled. I could endure it all,\\r\\nill-usage, solitude, a life of deception, everything, as long as I could\\r\\nstill cling to the hope that I had his love, but now I know that in\\r\\nthis also I have been his dupe and his tool.\" She broke into passionate\\r\\nsobbing as she spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You bear him no good will, madam,\" said Holmes. \"Tell us then where we\\r\\nshall find him. If you have ever aided him in evil, help us now and so\\r\\natone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is but one place where he can have fled,\" she answered. \"There is\\r\\nan old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire. It was there that\\r\\nhe kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that he\\r\\nmight have a refuge. That is where he would fly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes held the\\r\\nlamp towards it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See,\" said he. \"No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire\\r\\ntonight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed and clapped her hands. Her eyes and teeth gleamed with\\r\\nfierce merriment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He may find his way in, but never out,\" she cried. \"How can he see the\\r\\nguiding wands tonight? We planted them together, he and I, to mark the\\r\\npathway through the mire. Oh, if I could only have plucked them out\\r\\ntoday. Then indeed you would have had him at your mercy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had\\r\\nlifted. Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the house while\\r\\nHolmes and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville Hall. The story\\r\\nof the Stapletons could no longer be withheld from him, but he took\\r\\nthe blow bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom he had\\r\\nloved. But the shock of the night\\'s adventures had shattered his nerves,\\r\\nand before morning he lay delirious in a high fever under the care of\\r\\nDr. Mortimer. The two of them were destined to travel together round the\\r\\nworld before Sir Henry had become once more the hale, hearty man that he\\r\\nhad been before he became master of that ill-omened estate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now I come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular narrative, in\\r\\nwhich I have tried to make the reader share those dark fears and vague\\r\\nsurmises which clouded our lives so long and ended in so tragic a\\r\\nmanner. On the morning after the death of the hound the fog had lifted\\r\\nand we were guided by Mrs. Stapleton to the point where they had found\\r\\na pathway through the bog. It helped us to realize the horror of this\\r\\nwoman\\'s life when we saw the eagerness and joy with which she laid us\\r\\non her husband\\'s track. We left her standing upon the thin peninsula of\\r\\nfirm, peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog. From the\\r\\nend of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the path\\r\\nzigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those green-scummed pits\\r\\nand foul quagmires which barred the way to the stranger. Rank reeds and\\r\\nlush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic\\r\\nvapour onto our faces, while a false step plunged us more than once\\r\\nthigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft\\r\\nundulations around our feet. Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as\\r\\nwe walked, and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was\\r\\ntugging us down into those obscene depths, so grim and purposeful was\\r\\nthe clutch in which it held us. Once only we saw a trace that someone\\r\\nhad passed that perilous way before us. From amid a tuft of cotton grass\\r\\nwhich bore it up out of the slime some dark thing was projecting. Holmes\\r\\nsank to his waist as he stepped from the path to seize it, and had we\\r\\nnot been there to drag him out he could never have set his foot\\r\\nupon firm land again. He held an old black boot in the air. \"Meyers,\\r\\nToronto,\" was printed on the leather inside.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is worth a mud bath,\" said he. \"It is our friend Sir Henry\\'s missing\\r\\nboot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thrown there by Stapleton in his flight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly. He retained it in his hand after using it to set the hound\\r\\nupon the track. He fled when he knew the game was up, still clutching\\r\\nit. And he hurled it away at this point of his flight. We know at least\\r\\nthat he came so far in safety.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut more than that we were never destined to know, though there was much\\r\\nwhich we might surmise. There was no chance of finding footsteps in the\\r\\nmire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon them, but as we at last\\r\\nreached firmer ground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly for them.\\r\\nBut no slightest sign of them ever met our eyes. If the earth told a\\r\\ntrue story, then Stapleton never reached that island of refuge towards\\r\\nwhich he struggled through the fog upon that last night. Somewhere in\\r\\nthe heart of the great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the\\r\\nhuge morass which had sucked him in, this cold and cruel-hearted man is\\r\\nforever buried.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany traces we found of him in the bog-girt island where he had hid his\\r\\nsavage ally. A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled with rubbish\\r\\nshowed the position of an abandoned mine. Beside it were the crumbling\\r\\nremains of the cottages of the miners, driven away no doubt by the foul\\r\\nreek of the surrounding swamp. In one of these a staple and chain with\\r\\na quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined.\\r\\nA skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the\\r\\ndebris.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A dog!\" said Holmes. \"By Jove, a curly-haired spaniel. Poor Mortimer\\r\\nwill never see his pet again. Well, I do not know that this place\\r\\ncontains any secret which we have not already fathomed. He could hide\\r\\nhis hound, but he could not hush its voice, and hence came those cries\\r\\nwhich even in daylight were not pleasant to hear. On an emergency he\\r\\ncould keep the hound in the out-house at Merripit, but it was always a\\r\\nrisk, and it was only on the supreme day, which he regarded as the end\\r\\nof all his efforts, that he dared do it. This paste in the tin is no\\r\\ndoubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed. It was\\r\\nsuggested, of course, by the story of the family hell-hound, and by the\\r\\ndesire to frighten old Sir Charles to death. No wonder the poor devil of\\r\\na convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did, and as we ourselves\\r\\nmight have done, when he saw such a creature bounding through the\\r\\ndarkness of the moor upon his track. It was a cunning device, for, apart\\r\\nfrom the chance of driving your victim to his death, what peasant would\\r\\nventure to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight\\r\\nof it, as many have done, upon the moor? I said it in London, Watson,\\r\\nand I say it again now, that never yet have we helped to hunt down a\\r\\nmore dangerous man than he who is lying yonder\"--he swept his long arm\\r\\ntowards the huge mottled expanse of green-splotched bog which stretched\\r\\naway until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 15. A Retrospection\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the end of November, and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and foggy\\r\\nnight, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room in Baker\\r\\nStreet. Since the tragic upshot of our visit to Devonshire he had been\\r\\nengaged in two affairs of the utmost importance, in the first of which\\r\\nhe had exposed the atrocious conduct of Colonel Upwood in connection\\r\\nwith the famous card scandal of the Nonpareil Club, while in the second\\r\\nhe had defended the unfortunate Mme. Montpensier from the charge\\r\\nof murder which hung over her in connection with the death of her\\r\\nstep-daughter, Mlle. Carere, the young lady who, as it will be\\r\\nremembered, was found six months later alive and married in New York.\\r\\nMy friend was in excellent spirits over the success which had attended\\r\\na succession of difficult and important cases, so that I was able to\\r\\ninduce him to discuss the details of the Baskerville mystery. I had\\r\\nwaited patiently for the opportunity for I was aware that he would never\\r\\npermit cases to overlap, and that his clear and logical mind would not\\r\\nbe drawn from its present work to dwell upon memories of the past. Sir\\r\\nHenry and Dr. Mortimer were, however, in London, on their way to that\\r\\nlong voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his\\r\\nshattered nerves. They had called upon us that very afternoon, so that\\r\\nit was natural that the subject should come up for discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The whole course of events,\" said Holmes, \"from the point of view of\\r\\nthe man who called himself Stapleton was simple and direct, although\\r\\nto us, who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of\\r\\nhis actions and could only learn part of the facts, it all appeared\\r\\nexceedingly complex. I have had the advantage of two conversations with\\r\\nMrs. Stapleton, and the case has now been so entirely cleared up that I\\r\\nam not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret to us.\\r\\nYou will find a few notes upon the matter under the heading B in my\\r\\nindexed list of cases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of events from\\r\\nmemory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, though I cannot guarantee that I carry all the facts in my\\r\\nmind. Intense mental concentration has a curious way of blotting out\\r\\nwhat has passed. The barrister who has his case at his fingers\\' ends and\\r\\nis able to argue with an expert upon his own subject finds that a week\\r\\nor two of the courts will drive it all out of his head once more. So\\r\\neach of my cases displaces the last, and Mlle. Carere has blurred my\\r\\nrecollection of Baskerville Hall. Tomorrow some other little problem may\\r\\nbe submitted to my notice which will in turn dispossess the fair French\\r\\nlady and the infamous Upwood. So far as the case of the hound goes,\\r\\nhowever, I will give you the course of events as nearly as I can, and\\r\\nyou will suggest anything which I may have forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not\\r\\nlie, and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville. He was a son of that\\r\\nRodger Baskerville, the younger brother of Sir Charles, who fled with\\r\\na sinister reputation to South America, where he was said to have died\\r\\nunmarried. He did, as a matter of fact, marry, and had one child, this\\r\\nfellow, whose real name is the same as his father\\'s. He married Beryl\\r\\nGarcia, one of the beauties of Costa Rica, and, having purloined a\\r\\nconsiderable sum of public money, he changed his name to Vandeleur and\\r\\nfled to England, where he established a school in the east of Yorkshire.\\r\\nHis reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had\\r\\nstruck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage\\r\\nhome, and that he had used this man\\'s ability to make the undertaking a\\r\\nsuccess. Fraser, the tutor, died however, and the school which had begun\\r\\nwell sank from disrepute into infamy. The Vandeleurs found it convenient\\r\\nto change their name to Stapleton, and he brought the remains of his\\r\\nfortune, his schemes for the future, and his taste for entomology to\\r\\nthe south of England. I learned at the British Museum that he was a\\r\\nrecognized authority upon the subject, and that the name of Vandeleur\\r\\nhas been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had, in his\\r\\nYorkshire days, been the first to describe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be of such\\r\\nintense interest to us. The fellow had evidently made inquiry and found\\r\\nthat only two lives intervened between him and a valuable estate. When\\r\\nhe went to Devonshire his plans were, I believe, exceedingly hazy, but\\r\\nthat he meant mischief from the first is evident from the way in which\\r\\nhe took his wife with him in the character of his sister. The idea of\\r\\nusing her as a decoy was clearly already in his mind, though he may not\\r\\nhave been certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged. He\\r\\nmeant in the end to have the estate, and he was ready to use any tool\\r\\nor run any risk for that end. His first act was to establish himself as\\r\\nnear to his ancestral home as he could, and his second was to cultivate\\r\\na friendship with Sir Charles Baskerville and with the neighbours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The baronet himself told him about the family hound, and so prepared\\r\\nthe way for his own death. Stapleton, as I will continue to call him,\\r\\nknew that the old man\\'s heart was weak and that a shock would kill him.\\r\\nSo much he had learned from Dr. Mortimer. He had heard also that Sir\\r\\nCharles was superstitious and had taken this grim legend very seriously.\\r\\nHis ingenious mind instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could\\r\\nbe done to death, and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the\\r\\nguilt to the real murderer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with\\r\\nconsiderable finesse. An ordinary schemer would have been content\\r\\nto work with a savage hound. The use of artificial means to make the\\r\\ncreature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part. The dog he\\r\\nbought in London from Ross and Mangles, the dealers in Fulham Road. It\\r\\nwas the strongest and most savage in their possession. He brought it\\r\\ndown by the North Devon line and walked a great distance over the moor\\r\\nso as to get it home without exciting any remarks. He had already on his\\r\\ninsect hunts learned to penetrate the Grimpen Mire, and so had found a\\r\\nsafe hiding-place for the creature. Here he kennelled it and waited his\\r\\nchance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it was some time coming. The old gentleman could not be decoyed\\r\\noutside of his grounds at night. Several times Stapleton lurked about\\r\\nwith his hound, but without avail. It was during these fruitless quests\\r\\nthat he, or rather his ally, was seen by peasants, and that the legend\\r\\nof the demon dog received a new confirmation. He had hoped that his wife\\r\\nmight lure Sir Charles to his ruin, but here she proved unexpectedly\\r\\nindependent. She would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in\\r\\na sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy.\\r\\nThreats and even, I am sorry to say, blows refused to move her. She\\r\\nwould have nothing to do with it, and for a time Stapleton was at a\\r\\ndeadlock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that Sir\\r\\nCharles, who had conceived a friendship for him, made him the minister\\r\\nof his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman, Mrs. Laura Lyons.\\r\\nBy representing himself as a single man he acquired complete influence\\r\\nover her, and he gave her to understand that in the event of her\\r\\nobtaining a divorce from her husband he would marry her. His plans were\\r\\nsuddenly brought to a head by his knowledge that Sir Charles was about\\r\\nto leave the Hall on the advice of Dr. Mortimer, with whose opinion he\\r\\nhimself pretended to coincide. He must act at once, or his victim might\\r\\nget beyond his power. He therefore put pressure upon Mrs. Lyons to\\r\\nwrite this letter, imploring the old man to give her an interview on\\r\\nthe evening before his departure for London. He then, by a specious\\r\\nargument, prevented her from going, and so had the chance for which he\\r\\nhad waited.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Driving back in the evening from Coombe Tracey he was in time to get\\r\\nhis hound, to treat it with his infernal paint, and to bring the beast\\r\\nround to the gate at which he had reason to expect that he would find\\r\\nthe old gentleman waiting. The dog, incited by its master, sprang over\\r\\nthe wicket-gate and pursued the unfortunate baronet, who fled screaming\\r\\ndown the yew alley. In that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a\\r\\ndreadful sight to see that huge black creature, with its flaming jaws\\r\\nand blazing eyes, bounding after its victim. He fell dead at the end\\r\\nof the alley from heart disease and terror. The hound had kept upon the\\r\\ngrassy border while the baronet had run down the path, so that no track\\r\\nbut the man\\'s was visible. On seeing him lying still the creature had\\r\\nprobably approached to sniff at him, but finding him dead had turned\\r\\naway again. It was then that it left the print which was actually\\r\\nobserved by Dr. Mortimer. The hound was called off and hurried away to\\r\\nits lair in the Grimpen Mire, and a mystery was left which puzzled\\r\\nthe authorities, alarmed the countryside, and finally brought the case\\r\\nwithin the scope of our observation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much for the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. You perceive the\\r\\ndevilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost impossible to make\\r\\na case against the real murderer. His only accomplice was one who could\\r\\nnever give him away, and the grotesque, inconceivable nature of\\r\\nthe device only served to make it more effective. Both of the women\\r\\nconcerned in the case, Mrs. Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons, were left\\r\\nwith a strong suspicion against Stapleton. Mrs. Stapleton knew that he\\r\\nhad designs upon the old man, and also of the existence of the hound.\\r\\nMrs. Lyons knew neither of these things, but had been impressed by the\\r\\ndeath occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was only\\r\\nknown to him. However, both of them were under his influence, and he had\\r\\nnothing to fear from them. The first half of his task was successfully\\r\\naccomplished but the more difficult still remained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is possible that Stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir\\r\\nin Canada. In any case he would very soon learn it from his friend Dr.\\r\\nMortimer, and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of\\r\\nHenry Baskerville. Stapleton\\'s first idea was that this young stranger\\r\\nfrom Canada might possibly be done to death in London without coming\\r\\ndown to Devonshire at all. He distrusted his wife ever since she had\\r\\nrefused to help him in laying a trap for the old man, and he dared not\\r\\nleave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence\\r\\nover her. It was for this reason that he took her to London with him.\\r\\nThey lodged, I find, at the Mexborough Private Hotel, in Craven Street,\\r\\nwhich was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search\\r\\nof evidence. Here he kept his wife imprisoned in her room while\\r\\nhe, disguised in a beard, followed Dr. Mortimer to Baker Street and\\r\\nafterwards to the station and to the Northumberland Hotel. His wife had\\r\\nsome inkling of his plans; but she had such a fear of her husband--a\\r\\nfear founded upon brutal ill-treatment--that she dare not write to warn\\r\\nthe man whom she knew to be in danger. If the letter should fall into\\r\\nStapleton\\'s hands her own life would not be safe. Eventually, as we\\r\\nknow, she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would\\r\\nform the message, and addressing the letter in a disguised hand. It\\r\\nreached the baronet, and gave him the first warning of his danger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was very essential for Stapleton to get some article of Sir Henry\\'s\\r\\nattire so that, in case he was driven to use the dog, he might always\\r\\nhave the means of setting him upon his track. With characteristic\\r\\npromptness and audacity he set about this at once, and we cannot doubt\\r\\nthat the boots or chamber-maid of the hotel was well bribed to help him\\r\\nin his design. By chance, however, the first boot which was procured for\\r\\nhim was a new one and, therefore, useless for his purpose. He then had\\r\\nit returned and obtained another--a most instructive incident, since it\\r\\nproved conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound,\\r\\nas no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old\\r\\nboot and this indifference to a new one. The more outre and grotesque an\\r\\nincident is the more carefully it deserves to be examined, and the very\\r\\npoint which appears to complicate a case is, when duly considered and\\r\\nscientifically handled, the one which is most likely to elucidate it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then we had the visit from our friends next morning, shadowed always\\r\\nby Stapleton in the cab. From his knowledge of our rooms and of my\\r\\nappearance, as well as from his general conduct, I am inclined to think\\r\\nthat Stapleton\\'s career of crime has been by no means limited to this\\r\\nsingle Baskerville affair. It is suggestive that during the last three\\r\\nyears there have been four considerable burglaries in the west country,\\r\\nfor none of which was any criminal ever arrested. The last of these, at\\r\\nFolkestone Court, in May, was remarkable for the cold-blooded pistolling\\r\\nof the page, who surprised the masked and solitary burglar. I cannot\\r\\ndoubt that Stapleton recruited his waning resources in this fashion, and\\r\\nthat for years he has been a desperate and dangerous man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when he got\\r\\naway from us so successfully, and also of his audacity in sending back\\r\\nmy own name to me through the cabman. From that moment he understood\\r\\nthat I had taken over the case in London, and that therefore there was\\r\\nno chance for him there. He returned to Dartmoor and awaited the arrival\\r\\nof the baronet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One moment!\" said I. \"You have, no doubt, described the sequence\\r\\nof events correctly, but there is one point which you have left\\r\\nunexplained. What became of the hound when its master was in London?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly of\\r\\nimportance. There can be no question that Stapleton had a confidant,\\r\\nthough it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in his power by\\r\\nsharing all his plans with him. There was an old manservant at Merripit\\r\\nHouse, whose name was Anthony. His connection with the Stapletons can\\r\\nbe traced for several years, as far back as the school-mastering days,\\r\\nso that he must have been aware that his master and mistress were really\\r\\nhusband and wife. This man has disappeared and has escaped from the\\r\\ncountry. It is suggestive that Anthony is not a common name in England,\\r\\nwhile Antonio is so in all Spanish or Spanish-American countries. The\\r\\nman, like Mrs. Stapleton herself, spoke good English, but with a curious\\r\\nlisping accent. I have myself seen this old man cross the Grimpen\\r\\nMire by the path which Stapleton had marked out. It is very probable,\\r\\ntherefore, that in the absence of his master it was he who cared for the\\r\\nhound, though he may never have known the purpose for which the beast\\r\\nwas used.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Stapletons then went down to Devonshire, whither they were soon\\r\\nfollowed by Sir Henry and you. One word now as to how I stood myself at\\r\\nthat time. It may possibly recur to your memory that when I examined\\r\\nthe paper upon which the printed words were fastened I made a close\\r\\ninspection for the water-mark. In doing so I held it within a few inches\\r\\nof my eyes, and was conscious of a faint smell of the scent known as\\r\\nwhite jessamine. There are seventy-five perfumes, which it is very\\r\\nnecessary that a criminal expert should be able to distinguish from each\\r\\nother, and cases have more than once within my own experience depended\\r\\nupon their prompt recognition. The scent suggested the presence of a\\r\\nlady, and already my thoughts began to turn towards the Stapletons. Thus\\r\\nI had made certain of the hound, and had guessed at the criminal before\\r\\never we went to the west country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was my game to watch Stapleton. It was evident, however, that I\\r\\ncould not do this if I were with you, since he would be keenly on his\\r\\nguard. I deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included, and I came\\r\\ndown secretly when I was supposed to be in London. My hardships were\\r\\nnot so great as you imagined, though such trifling details must never\\r\\ninterfere with the investigation of a case. I stayed for the most\\r\\npart at Coombe Tracey, and only used the hut upon the moor when it was\\r\\nnecessary to be near the scene of action. Cartwright had come down with\\r\\nme, and in his disguise as a country boy he was of great assistance\\r\\nto me. I was dependent upon him for food and clean linen. When I was\\r\\nwatching Stapleton, Cartwright was frequently watching you, so that I\\r\\nwas able to keep my hand upon all the strings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly, being\\r\\nforwarded instantly from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey. They were of\\r\\ngreat service to me, and especially that one incidentally truthful piece\\r\\nof biography of Stapleton\\'s. I was able to establish the identity of\\r\\nthe man and the woman and knew at last exactly how I stood. The case\\r\\nhad been considerably complicated through the incident of the escaped\\r\\nconvict and the relations between him and the Barrymores. This also you\\r\\ncleared up in a very effective way, though I had already come to the\\r\\nsame conclusions from my own observations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By the time that you discovered me upon the moor I had a complete\\r\\nknowledge of the whole business, but I had not a case which could go to\\r\\na jury. Even Stapleton\\'s attempt upon Sir Henry that night which ended\\r\\nin the death of the unfortunate convict did not help us much in proving\\r\\nmurder against our man. There seemed to be no alternative but to\\r\\ncatch him red-handed, and to do so we had to use Sir Henry, alone and\\r\\napparently unprotected, as a bait. We did so, and at the cost of a\\r\\nsevere shock to our client we succeeded in completing our case and\\r\\ndriving Stapleton to his destruction. That Sir Henry should have been\\r\\nexposed to this is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the\\r\\ncase, but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing\\r\\nspectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fog which\\r\\nenabled him to burst upon us at such short notice. We succeeded in our\\r\\nobject at a cost which both the specialist and Dr. Mortimer assure me\\r\\nwill be a temporary one. A long journey may enable our friend to recover\\r\\nnot only from his shattered nerves but also from his wounded feelings.\\r\\nHis love for the lady was deep and sincere, and to him the saddest part\\r\\nof all this black business was that he should have been deceived by her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It only remains to indicate the part which she had played throughout.\\r\\nThere can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an influence over her\\r\\nwhich may have been love or may have been fear, or very possibly both,\\r\\nsince they are by no means incompatible emotions. It was, at least,\\r\\nabsolutely effective. At his command she consented to pass as his\\r\\nsister, though he found the limits of his power over her when he\\r\\nendeavoured to make her the direct accessory to murder. She was ready to\\r\\nwarn Sir Henry so far as she could without implicating her husband, and\\r\\nagain and again she tried to do so. Stapleton himself seems to have been\\r\\ncapable of jealousy, and when he saw the baronet paying court to the\\r\\nlady, even though it was part of his own plan, still he could not help\\r\\ninterrupting with a passionate outburst which revealed the fiery soul\\r\\nwhich his self-contained manner so cleverly concealed. By encouraging\\r\\nthe intimacy he made it certain that Sir Henry would frequently come\\r\\nto Merripit House and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity\\r\\nwhich he desired. On the day of the crisis, however, his wife turned\\r\\nsuddenly against him. She had learned something of the death of the\\r\\nconvict, and she knew that the hound was being kept in the outhouse on\\r\\nthe evening that Sir Henry was coming to dinner. She taxed her husband\\r\\nwith his intended crime, and a furious scene followed in which he showed\\r\\nher for the first time that she had a rival in his love. Her fidelity\\r\\nturned in an instant to bitter hatred, and he saw that she would betray\\r\\nhim. He tied her up, therefore, that she might have no chance of warning\\r\\nSir Henry, and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole countryside put\\r\\ndown the baronet\\'s death to the curse of his family, as they certainly\\r\\nwould do, he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished fact and\\r\\nto keep silent upon what she knew. In this I fancy that in any case\\r\\nhe made a miscalculation, and that, if we had not been there, his doom\\r\\nwould none the less have been sealed. A woman of Spanish blood does\\r\\nnot condone such an injury so lightly. And now, my dear Watson, without\\r\\nreferring to my notes, I cannot give you a more detailed account of\\r\\nthis curious case. I do not know that anything essential has been left\\r\\nunexplained.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to death as he had done the old\\r\\nuncle with his bogie hound.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The beast was savage and half-starved. If its appearance did not\\r\\nfrighten its victim to death, at least it would paralyze the resistance\\r\\nwhich might be offered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No doubt. There only remains one difficulty. If Stapleton came into the\\r\\nsuccession, how could he explain the fact that he, the heir, had been\\r\\nliving unannounced under another name so close to the property? How\\r\\ncould he claim it without causing suspicion and inquiry?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a formidable difficulty, and I fear that you ask too much when\\r\\nyou expect me to solve it. The past and the present are within the field\\r\\nof my inquiry, but what a man may do in the future is a hard question\\r\\nto answer. Mrs. Stapleton has heard her husband discuss the problem on\\r\\nseveral occasions. There were three possible courses. He might claim the\\r\\nproperty from South America, establish his identity before the British\\r\\nauthorities there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to\\r\\nEngland at all, or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the\\r\\nshort time that he need be in London; or, again, he might furnish an\\r\\naccomplice with the proofs and papers, putting him in as heir, and\\r\\nretaining a claim upon some proportion of his income. We cannot doubt\\r\\nfrom what we know of him that he would have found some way out of the\\r\\ndifficulty. And now, my dear Watson, we have had some weeks of severe\\r\\nwork, and for one evening, I think, we may turn our thoughts into more\\r\\npleasant channels. I have a box for \\'Les Huguenots.\\' Have you heard the\\r\\nDe Reszkes? Might I trouble you then to be ready in half an hour, and we\\r\\ncan stop at Marcini\\'s for a little dinner on the way?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s The Hound of the Baskervilles, by A.

In the _Cecilia_\\r\\nof Madame D\\'Arblay--the forerunner, if not the model, of Miss Austen--is a\\r\\nsentence which at first sight suggests some relationship to the name of\\r\\nthe book which, in the present series, inaugurated Miss Austen\\'s novels.\\r\\n\\'The whole of this unfortunate business\\'--says a certain didactic Dr.\\r\\nLyster, talking in capitals, towards the end of volume three of\\r\\n_Cecilia_--\\'has been the result of PRIDE and PREJUDICE,\\' and looking to\\r\\nthe admitted familiarity of Miss Austen with Madame D\\'Arblay\\'s work, it\\r\\nhas been concluded that Miss Austen borrowed from _Cecilia_, the title of\\r\\nher second novel. But here comes in the little problem to which we have\\r\\nreferred. _Pride and Prejudice_ it is true, was written and finished\\r\\nbefore _Sense and Sensibility_--its original title for several years being\\r\\n_First Impressions_. Then, in 1797, the author fell to work upon an older\\r\\nessay in letters _a la_ Richardson, called _Elinor and Marianne_, which\\r\\nshe re-christened _Sense and Sensibility._ This, as we know, was her first\\r\\npublished book; and whatever may be the connection between the title of\\r\\n_Pride and Prejudice_ and the passage in _Cecilia_, there is an obvious\\r\\nconnection between the title of _Pride and Prejudice_ and the _title of\\r\\nSense and Sensibility_. If Miss Austen re-christened _Elinor and\\r\\nMarianne_ before she changed the title of _First Impressions_, as she well\\r\\nmay have, it is extremely unlikely that the name of _Pride and Prejudice_\\r\\nhas anything to do with _Cecilia_ (which, besides, had been published at\\r\\nleast twenty years before). Upon the whole, therefore, it is most likely\\r\\nthat the passage in Madame D\\'Arblay is a mere coincidence; and that in\\r\\n_Sense and Sensibility_, as well as in the novel that succeeded it in\\r\\npublication, Miss Austen, after the fashion of the old morality plays,\\r\\nsimply substituted the leading characteristics of her principal personages\\r\\nfor their names. Indeed, in _Sense and Sensibility_ the sense of Elinor,\\r\\nand the sensibility (or rather _sensiblerie_) of Marianne, are markedly\\r\\nemphasised in the opening pages of the book But Miss Austen subsequently,\\r\\nand, as we think, wisely, discarded in her remaining efforts the cheap\\r\\nattraction of an alliterative title. _Emma_ and _Persuasion, Northanger\\r\\nAbbey_ and _Mansfield Park_, are names far more in consonance with the\\r\\nquiet tone of her easy and unobtrusive art.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Elinor and Marianne_ was originally written about 1792. After the\\r\\ncompletion--or partial completion, for it was again revised in\\r\\n1811--of _First Impressions_ (subsequently _Pride and Prejudice_),\\r\\nMiss Austen set about recasting _Elinor and Marianne_, then composed\\r\\nin the form of letters; and she had no sooner accomplished this task,\\r\\nthan she began _Northanger Abbey_. It would be interesting to know to\\r\\nwhat extent she remodelled _Sense and Sensibility_ in 1797-98, for we\\r\\nare told that previous to its publication in 1811 she again devoted a\\r\\nconsiderable time to its preparation for the press, and it is clear\\r\\nthat this does not mean the correction of proofs alone, but also a\\r\\npreliminary revision of MS. Especially would it be interesting if we\\r\\ncould ascertain whether any of its more finished passages, _e.g._ the\\r\\nadmirable conversation between the Miss Dashwoods and Willoughby in\\r\\nchapter x., were the result of those fallow and apparently barren\\r\\nyears at Bath and Southampton, or whether they were already part of\\r\\nthe second version of 1797-98. But upon this matter the records are\\r\\nmute. A careful examination of the correspondence published by Lord\\r\\nBrabourne in 1884 only reveals two definite references to _Sense and\\r\\nSensibility_ and these are absolutely unfruitful in suggestion. In\\r\\nApril 1811 she speaks of having corrected two sheets of \\'S and S,\\'\\r\\nwhich she has scarcely a hope of getting out in the following June;\\r\\nand in September, an extract from the diary of another member of the\\r\\nfamily indirectly discloses the fact that the book had by that time\\r\\nbeen published. This extract is a brief reference to a letter which\\r\\nhad been received from Cassandra Austen, begging her correspondent not\\r\\nto mention that Aunt Jane wrote _Sense and Sensibility._ Beyond these\\r\\nminute items of information, and the statement--already referred to in\\r\\nthe Introduction to _Pride and Prejudice_--that she considered herself\\r\\noverpaid for the labour she had bestowed upon it, absolutely nothing\\r\\nseems to have been preserved by her descendants respecting her first\\r\\nprinted effort. In the absence of particulars some of her critics have\\r\\nfallen to speculate upon the reason which made her select it, and not\\r\\n_Pride and Prejudice_, for her debut; and they have, perhaps\\r\\nnaturally, found in the fact a fresh confirmation of that traditional\\r\\nblindness of authors to their own best work, which is one of the\\r\\ncommonplaces of literary history. But this is to premise that she\\r\\n_did_ regard it as her masterpiece, a fact which, apart from this\\r\\naccident of priority of issue, is, as far as we are aware, nowhere\\r\\nasserted. A simpler solution is probably that, of the three novels she\\r\\nhad written or sketched by 1811, _Pride and Prejudice_ was languishing\\r\\nunder the stigma of having been refused by one bookseller without the\\r\\nformality of inspection, while _Northanger Abbey_ was lying _perdu_ in\\r\\nanother bookseller\\'s drawer at Bath. In these circumstances it is\\r\\nintelligible that she should turn to _Sense and Sensibility_, when, at\\r\\nlength--upon the occasion of a visit to her brother in London in the\\r\\nspring of 1811--Mr. T. Egerton of the \\'Military Library,\\' Whitehall,\\r\\ndawned upon the horizon as a practicable publisher.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time _Sense and Sensibility_ left the press, Miss Austen was\\r\\nagain domiciled at Chawton Cottage. For those accustomed to the\\r\\nswarming reviews of our day, with their Babel of notices, it may seem\\r\\nstrange that there should be no record of the effect produced, seeing\\r\\nthat, as already stated, the book sold well enough to enable its\\r\\nputter-forth to hand over to its author what Mr. Gargery, in _Great\\r\\nExpectations_, would have described as \\'a cool L150.\\' Surely Mr.\\r\\nEgerton, who had visited Miss Austen at Sloane Street, must have later\\r\\nconveyed to her some intelligence of the way in which her work had\\r\\nbeen welcomed by the public. But if he did, it is no longer\\r\\ndiscoverable. Mr. Austen Leigh, her first and best biographer, could\\r\\nfind no account either of the publication or of the author\\'s feelings\\r\\nthereupon. As far as it is possible to judge, the critical verdicts\\r\\nshe obtained were mainly derived from her own relatives and intimate\\r\\nfriends, and some of these latter--if one may trust a little anthology\\r\\nwhich she herself collected, and from which Mr. Austen Leigh prints\\r\\nextracts--must have been more often exasperating than sympathetic. The\\r\\nlong chorus of intelligent approval by which she was afterwards\\r\\ngreeted did not begin to be really audible before her death, and her\\r\\n\\'fit audience\\' during her lifetime must have been emphatically \\'few,\\'\\r\\nOf two criticisms which came out in the _Quarterly_ early in the\\r\\ncentury, she could only have seen one, that of 1815; the other, by\\r\\nArchbishop Whately, the first which treated her in earnest, did not\\r\\nappear until she had been three years dead. Dr. Whately deals mainly\\r\\nwith _Mansfield Park_ and _Persuasion_; his predecessor professed to\\r\\nreview _Emma_, though he also gives brief summaries of _Sense and\\r\\nSensibility_ and _Pride and Prejudice_. Mr. Austen Leigh, we think,\\r\\nspeaks too contemptuously of this initial notice of 1815. If, at\\r\\ncertain points, it is half-hearted and inadequate, it is still fairly\\r\\naccurate in its recognition of Miss Austen\\'s supreme merit, as\\r\\ncontrasted with her contemporaries--to wit, her skill in investing the\\r\\nfortunes of ordinary characters and the narrative of common\\r\\noccurrences with all the sustained excitement of romance. The Reviewer\\r\\npoints out very justly that this kind of work, \\'being deprived of all\\r\\nthat, according to Bayes, goes \"to elevate and surprise,\" must make\\r\\namends by displaying depth of knowledge and dexterity of execution.\\'\\r\\nAnd in these qualities, even with such living competitors of her own\\r\\nsex as Miss Edgeworth and Miss Brunton (whose _Self-control_ came out\\r\\nin the same year as _Sense and Sensibility_), he does not scruple to\\r\\ndeclare that \\'Miss Austen stands almost alone.\\' If he omits to lay\\r\\nstress upon her judgment, her nice sense of fitness, her restraint,\\r\\nher fine irony, and the delicacy of her artistic touch, something must\\r\\nbe allowed for the hesitations and reservations which invariably beset\\r\\nthe critical pioneer.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo contend, however, for a moment that the present volume is Miss\\r\\nAusten\\'s greatest, as it was her first published, novel, would be a\\r\\nmere exercise in paradox. There are, who swear by _Persuasion_; there\\r\\nare, who prefer _Emma_ and _Mansfield Park_; there is a large\\r\\ncontingent for _Pride and Prejudice_; and there is even a section\\r\\nwhich advocates the pre-eminence of _Northanger Abbey_. But no one, as\\r\\nfar as we can remember, has ever put _Sense and Sensibility_ first,\\r\\nnor can we believe that its author did so herself. And yet it is she\\r\\nherself who has furnished the standard by which we judge it, and it is\\r\\nby comparison with _Pride and Prejudice_, in which the leading\\r\\ncharacters are also two sisters, that we assess and depress its merit.\\r\\nThe Elinor and Marianne of _Sense and Sensibility_ are only inferior\\r\\nwhen they are contrasted with the Elizabeth and Jane of _Pride and\\r\\nPrejudice_; and even then, it is probably because we personally like\\r\\nthe handsome and amiable Jane Bennet rather better than the obsolete\\r\\nsurvival of the sentimental novel represented by Marianne Dashwood.\\r\\nDarcy and Bingley again are much more \\'likeable\\' (to use Lady\\r\\nQueensberry\\'s word) than the colourless Edward Ferrars and the\\r\\nstiff-jointed Colonel Brandon. Yet it might not unfairly be contended\\r\\nthat there is more fidelity to what Mr. Thomas Hardy has termed\\r\\n\\'life\\'s little ironies\\' in Miss Austen\\'s disposal of the two Miss\\r\\nDashwoods than there is in her disposal of the heroines of _Pride and\\r\\nPrejudice_. Every one does not get a Bingley, or a Darcy (with a\\r\\npark); but a good many sensible girls like Elinor pair off contentedly\\r\\nwith poor creatures like Edward Ferrars, while not a few enthusiasts\\r\\nlike Marianne decline at last upon middle-aged colonels with flannel\\r\\nwaistcoats. George Eliot, we fancy, would have held that the fates of\\r\\nElinor and Marianne were more probable than the fortunes of Jane and\\r\\nEliza Bennet. That, of the remaining characters, there is certainly\\r\\nnone to rival Mr. Bennet, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, or the\\r\\nineffable Mr. Collins, of _Pride and Prejudice_, is true; but we\\r\\nconfess to a kindness for vulgar matchmaking Mrs. Jennings with her\\r\\nstill-room \\'parmaceti for an inward bruise\\' in the shape of a glass of\\r\\nold Constantia; and for the diluted Squire Western, Sir John\\r\\nMiddleton, whose horror of being alone carries him to the point of\\r\\nrejoicing in the acquisition of _two_ to the population of London.\\r\\nExcellent again are Mr. Palmer and his wife; excellent, in their\\r\\nsordid veracity, the self-seeking figures of the Miss Steeles. But the\\r\\npearls of the book must be allowed to be that egregious amateur in\\r\\ntoothpick-cases, Mr. Robert Ferrars (with his excursus in chapter\\r\\nxxxvi. on life in a cottage), and the admirably-matched Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nJohn Dashwood. Miss Austen herself has never done anything better than\\r\\nthe inimitable and oft-quoted chapter wherein is debated between the\\r\\nlast-named pair the momentous matter of the amount to be devoted to\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood and her daughters; while the suggestion in chapters\\r\\nxxxiii. and xxxiv. that the owner of Norland was once within some\\r\\nthousands of having to sell out at a loss, deserves to be remembered\\r\\nwith that other memorable escape of Sir Roger de Coverley\\'s ancestor,\\r\\nwho was only not killed in the civil wars because \\'he was sent out of\\r\\nthe field upon a private message, the day before the battle of\\r\\nWorcester.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nOf local colouring there is as little in _Sense and Sensibility_ as in\\r\\n_Pride and Prejudice_. It is not unlikely that some memories of\\r\\nSteventon may survive in Norland; and it may be noted that there is\\r\\nactually a Barton Place to the north of Exeter, not far from Lord\\r\\nIddesleigh\\'s well-known seat of Upton Pynes. It is scarcely possible,\\r\\nalso, not to believe that, in Mrs. Jennings\\'s description of\\r\\nDelaford--\\'a nice place, I can tell you; exactly what I call a nice\\r\\nold-fashioned place, full of comforts and conveniences; quite shut in\\r\\nwith great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit-trees in\\r\\nthe country; and such a mulberry tree in one corner!\\'--Miss Austen had\\r\\nin mind some real Hampshire or Devonshire country house. In any case,\\r\\nit comes nearer a picture than what we usually get from her pen. \\'Then\\r\\nthere is a dovecote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a very pretty\\r\\ncanal; and everything, in short, that one could wish for; and,\\r\\nmoreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile\\r\\nfrom the turnpike-road, so \\'tis never dull, for if you only go and sit\\r\\nup in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the\\r\\ncarriages that pass along.\\' The last lines suggest those quaint\\r\\n\\'gazebos\\' and alcoves, which, in the coaching days, were so often to\\r\\nbe found perched at the roadside, where one might sit and watch the\\r\\nDover or Canterbury stage go whirling by.

Their estate\\r\\nwas large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of\\r\\ntheir property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so\\r\\nrespectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their\\r\\nsurrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single\\r\\nman, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his\\r\\nlife, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her\\r\\ndeath, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great\\r\\nalteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and\\r\\nreceived into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood,\\r\\nthe legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he\\r\\nintended to bequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and\\r\\ntheir children, the old Gentleman\\'s days were comfortably spent. His\\r\\nattachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from\\r\\ninterest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid\\r\\ncomfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the\\r\\nchildren added a relish to his existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present\\r\\nlady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, was\\r\\namply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,\\r\\nand half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own\\r\\nmarriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his\\r\\nwealth. To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not\\r\\nso really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent\\r\\nof what might arise to them from their father\\'s inheriting that\\r\\nproperty, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their\\r\\nfather only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the\\r\\nremaining moiety of his first wife\\'s fortune was also secured to her\\r\\nchild, and he had only a life-interest in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every\\r\\nother will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. He was neither so\\r\\nunjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew; but\\r\\nhe left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the\\r\\nbequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife\\r\\nand daughters than for himself or his son; but to his son, and his\\r\\nson\\'s son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way,\\r\\nas to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most\\r\\ndear to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the\\r\\nestate, or by any sale of its valuable woods. The whole was tied up\\r\\nfor the benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his\\r\\nfather and mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of\\r\\nhis uncle, by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children\\r\\nof two or three years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest\\r\\ndesire of having his own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of\\r\\nnoise, as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which, for\\r\\nyears, he had received from his niece and her daughters. He meant not\\r\\nto be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection for the three\\r\\ngirls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dashwood\\'s disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper\\r\\nwas cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many\\r\\nyears, and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the\\r\\nproduce of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate\\r\\nimprovement. But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was\\r\\nhis only one twelvemonth. He survived his uncle no longer; and ten\\r\\nthousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained\\r\\nfor his widow and daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr.\\r\\nDashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness\\r\\ncould command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the\\r\\nfamily; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at\\r\\nsuch a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to make\\r\\nthem comfortable. His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,\\r\\nand Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there\\r\\nmight prudently be in his power to do for them.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _His son\\'s son, a child of four years old._]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted\\r\\nand rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well\\r\\nrespected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of\\r\\nhis ordinary duties. Had he married a more amiable woman, he might\\r\\nhave been made still more respectable than he was: he might even have\\r\\nbeen made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and\\r\\nvery fond of his wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature\\r\\nof himself; more narrow-minded and selfish.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to\\r\\nincrease the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand\\r\\npounds a-piece. He then really thought himself equal to it. The\\r\\nprospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,\\r\\nbesides the remaining half of his own mother\\'s fortune, warmed his\\r\\nheart, and made him feel capable of generosity. \"Yes, he would give\\r\\nthem three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would\\r\\nbe enough to make them completely easy. Three thousand pounds! he\\r\\ncould spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.\" He\\r\\nthought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did\\r\\nnot repent.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sooner was his father\\'s funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,\\r\\nwithout sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law,\\r\\narrived with her child and their attendants. No one could dispute her\\r\\nright to come; the house was her husband\\'s from the moment of his\\r\\nfather\\'s decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the\\r\\ngreater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood\\'s situation, with only common\\r\\nfeelings, must have been highly unpleasing. But in _her_ mind there\\r\\nwas a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any\\r\\noffence of the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a\\r\\nsource of immovable disgust. Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a\\r\\nfavourite with any of her husband\\'s family; but she had had no\\r\\nopportunity, till the present, of showing them with how little\\r\\nattention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion\\r\\nrequired it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so\\r\\nearnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on the\\r\\narrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had\\r\\nnot the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on\\r\\nthe propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three\\r\\nchildren determined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid\\r\\na breach with their brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed\\r\\na strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified\\r\\nher, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and\\r\\nenabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,\\r\\nthat eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led\\r\\nto imprudence. She had an excellent heart; her disposition was\\r\\naffectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern\\r\\nthem: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which\\r\\none of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne\\'s abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor\\'s.\\r\\nShe was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, her\\r\\njoys, could have no moderation. She was generous, amiable,\\r\\ninteresting: she was everything but prudent. The resemblance between\\r\\nher and her mother was strikingly great.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister\\'s sensibility; but\\r\\nby Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished. They encouraged each\\r\\nother now in the violence of their affliction. The agony of grief\\r\\nwhich overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought\\r\\nfor, was created again and again. They gave themselves up wholly to\\r\\ntheir sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection\\r\\nthat could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation\\r\\nin future. Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could\\r\\nstruggle, she could exert herself. She could consult with her brother,\\r\\ncould receive her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her with\\r\\nproper attention; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar\\r\\nexertion, and encourage her to similar forbearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl;\\r\\nbut as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne\\'s romance,\\r\\nwithout having much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair\\r\\nto equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and her\\r\\nmother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors.\\r\\nAs such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility; and by\\r\\nher husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody\\r\\nbeyond himself, his wife, and their child. He really pressed them,\\r\\nwith some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as no\\r\\nplan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she\\r\\ncould accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his\\r\\ninvitation was accepted.\\r\\n\\r\\nA continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former\\r\\ndelight, was exactly what suited her mind. In seasons of cheerfulness,\\r\\nno temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greater\\r\\ndegree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness\\r\\nitself. But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,\\r\\nand as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended\\r\\nto do for his sisters. To take three thousand pounds from the fortune\\r\\nof their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most\\r\\ndreadful degree. She begged him to think again on the subject. How\\r\\ncould he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child\\r\\ntoo, of so large a sum? And what possible claim could the Miss\\r\\nDashwoods, who were related to him only by half blood, which she\\r\\nconsidered as no relationship at all, have on his generosity to so\\r\\nlarge an amount. It was very well known that no affection was ever\\r\\nsupposed to exist between the children of any man by different\\r\\nmarriages; and why was he to ruin himself, and their poor little\\r\\nHarry, by giving away all his money to his half sisters?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was my father\\'s last request to me,\" replied her husband, \"that I\\r\\nshould assist his widow and daughters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but he\\r\\nwas light-headed at the time. Had he been in his right senses, he\\r\\ncould not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away\\r\\nhalf your fortune from your own child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he only\\r\\nrequested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make their\\r\\nsituation more comfortable than it was in his power to do. Perhaps it\\r\\nwould have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself. He could\\r\\nhardly suppose I should neglect them. But as he required the promise,\\r\\nI could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time.\\r\\nThe promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed. Something\\r\\nmust be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new\\r\\nhome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, _let_ something be done for them; but _that_ something\\r\\nneed not be three thousand pounds. Consider,\" she added, \"that when\\r\\nthe money is once parted with, it never can return. Your sisters will\\r\\nmarry, and it will be gone for ever. If, indeed, it could be restored\\r\\nto our poor little boy--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, to be sure,\" said her husband, very gravely, \"that would make\\r\\ngreat difference. The time may come when Harry will regret that so\\r\\nlarge a sum was parted with. If he should have a numerous family, for\\r\\ninstance, it would be a very convenient addition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure it would.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum were\\r\\ndiminished one half. Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious\\r\\nincrease to their fortunes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! beyond anything great! What brother on earth would do half so\\r\\nmuch for his sisters, even if _really_ his sisters! And as it is--only\\r\\nhalf blood! But you have such a generous spirit!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not wish to do any thing mean,\" he replied. \"One had rather,\\r\\non such occasions, do too much than too little. No one, at least, can\\r\\nthink I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can\\r\\nhardly expect more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is no knowing what _they_ may expect,\" said the lady, \"but we\\r\\nare not to think of their expectations: the question is, what you can\\r\\nafford to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly; and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds\\r\\na-piece. As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each have\\r\\nabout three thousand pounds on their mother\\'s death--a very\\r\\ncomfortable fortune for any young woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want no\\r\\naddition at all. They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst\\r\\nthem. If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they do\\r\\nnot, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of\\r\\nten thousand pounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon the\\r\\nwhole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother\\r\\nwhile she lives, rather than for them--something of the annuity kind I\\r\\nmean. My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.\\r\\nA hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her consent to this\\r\\nplan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure,\" said she, \"it is better than parting with fifteen\\r\\nhundred pounds at once. But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood should live\\r\\nfifteen years we shall be completely taken in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half that\\r\\npurchase.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when\\r\\nthere is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and\\r\\nhealthy, and hardly forty. An annuity is a very serious business; it\\r\\ncomes over and over every year, and there is no getting rid of it. You\\r\\nare not aware of what you are doing. I have known a great deal of the\\r\\ntrouble of annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of\\r\\nthree to old superannuated servants by my father\\'s will, and it is\\r\\namazing how disagreeable she found it. Twice every year these\\r\\nannuities were to be paid; and then there was the trouble of getting\\r\\nit to them; and then one of them was said to have died, and afterwards\\r\\nit turned out to be no such thing. My mother was quite sick of it. Her\\r\\nincome was not her own, she said, with such perpetual claims on it;\\r\\nand it was the more unkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money\\r\\nwould have been entirely at my mother\\'s disposal, without any\\r\\nrestriction whatever. It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities,\\r\\nthat I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for\\r\\nall the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is certainly an unpleasant thing,\" replied Mr. Dashwood, \"to have\\r\\nthose kind of yearly drains on one\\'s income. One\\'s fortune, as your\\r\\nmother justly says, is _not_ one\\'s own. To be tied down to the regular\\r\\npayment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it\\r\\ntakes away one\\'s independence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it. They think\\r\\nthemselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raises\\r\\nno gratitude at all. If I were you, whatever I did should be done at\\r\\nmy own discretion entirely. I would not bind myself to allow them any\\r\\nthing yearly. It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a\\r\\nhundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should\\r\\nbe no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will\\r\\nbe of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they\\r\\nwould only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger\\r\\nincome, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the\\r\\nyear. It will certainly be much the best way. A present of fifty\\r\\npounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for\\r\\nmoney, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my\\r\\nfather.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure it will. Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within\\r\\nmyself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at\\r\\nall. The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might\\r\\nbe reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for a\\r\\ncomfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things,\\r\\nand sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever\\r\\nthey are in season. I\\'ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther;\\r\\nindeed, it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did. Do but\\r\\nconsider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your\\r\\nmother-in-law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven\\r\\nthousand pounds, besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the\\r\\ngirls, which brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of\\r\\ncourse, they will pay their mother for their board out of it.\\r\\nAltogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them, and what\\r\\non earth can four women want for more than that?--They will live so\\r\\ncheap! Their housekeeping will be nothing at all. They will have no\\r\\ncarriage, no horses, and hardly any servants; they will keep no\\r\\ncompany, and can have no expenses of any kind! Only conceive how\\r\\ncomfortable they will be! Five hundred a year! I am sure I cannot\\r\\nimagine how they will spend half of it; and as to your giving them\\r\\nmore, it is quite absurd to think of it. They will be much more able\\r\\nto give _you_ something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" said Mr. Dashwood, \"I believe you are perfectly right.\\r\\nMy father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than\\r\\nwhat you say. I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil\\r\\nmy engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you\\r\\nhave described. When my mother removes into another house my services\\r\\nshall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can. Some little\\r\\npresent of furniture too may be acceptable then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" returned Mrs. John Dashwood. \"But, however, _one_ thing\\r\\nmust be considered. When your father and mother moved to Norland,\\r\\nthough the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, and\\r\\nlinen was saved, and is now left to your mother. Her house will\\r\\ntherefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a material consideration undoubtedly. A valuable legacy\\r\\nindeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant\\r\\naddition to our own stock here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what\\r\\nbelongs to this house. A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, for\\r\\nany place _they_ can ever afford to live in. But, however, so it is.\\r\\nYour father thought only of _them_ And I must say this: that you owe\\r\\nno particular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes; for we\\r\\nvery well know that if he could, he would have left almost everything\\r\\nin the world to _them._\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis argument was irresistible. It gave to his intentions whatever of\\r\\ndecision was wanting before; and he finally resolved, that it would be\\r\\nabsolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for the\\r\\nwidow and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly acts\\r\\nas his own wife pointed out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from any\\r\\ndisinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased\\r\\nto raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for when\\r\\nher spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some other\\r\\nexertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy\\r\\nremembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her\\r\\ninquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; for\\r\\nto remove far from that beloved spot was impossible. But she could\\r\\nhear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and\\r\\nease, and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadier\\r\\njudgment rejected several houses as too large for their income, which\\r\\nher mother would have approved.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: \"_I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it._\"]\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise\\r\\non the part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his last\\r\\nearthly reflections. She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no\\r\\nmore than he had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her\\r\\ndaughters\\' sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was\\r\\npersuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her\\r\\nin affluence. For their brother\\'s sake, too, for the sake of his own\\r\\nheart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to\\r\\nhis merit before, in believing him incapable of generosity. His\\r\\nattentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that\\r\\ntheir welfare was dear to him, and, for a long time, she firmly relied\\r\\non the liberality of his intentions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt for\\r\\nher daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the farther knowledge\\r\\nof her character, which half a year\\'s residence in her family\\r\\nafforded; and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or\\r\\nmaternal affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might\\r\\nhave found it impossible to have lived together so long, had not a\\r\\nparticular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility,\\r\\naccording to the opinions of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters\\'\\r\\ncontinuance at Norland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and\\r\\nthe brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentlemanlike and pleasing young\\r\\nman, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister\\'s\\r\\nestablishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part of\\r\\nhis time there.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of\\r\\ninterest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died\\r\\nvery rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence,\\r\\nfor, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune depended on the\\r\\nwill of his mother. But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either\\r\\nconsideration. It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,\\r\\nthat he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality.\\r\\nIt was contrary to every doctrine of her\\'s that difference of fortune\\r\\nshould keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of\\r\\ndisposition; and that Elinor\\'s merit should not be acknowledged by\\r\\nevery one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any\\r\\npeculiar graces of person or address. He was not handsome, and his\\r\\nmanners required intimacy to make them pleasing. He was too diffident\\r\\nto do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,\\r\\nhis behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart.\\r\\nHis understanding was good, and his education had given it solid\\r\\nimprovement. But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to\\r\\nanswer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see him\\r\\ndistinguished as--they hardly knew what. They wanted him to make a\\r\\nfine figure in the world in some manner or other. His mother wished to\\r\\ninterest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to\\r\\nsee him connected with some of the great men of the day. Mrs. John\\r\\nDashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of these\\r\\nsuperior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted her\\r\\nambition to see him driving a barouche. But Edward had no turn for\\r\\ngreat men or barouches. All his wishes centered in domestic comfort\\r\\nand the quiet of private life. Fortunately he had a younger brother\\r\\nwho was more promising.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged\\r\\nmuch of Mrs. Dashwood\\'s attention; for she was, at that time, in such\\r\\naffliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects. She saw\\r\\nonly that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it. He\\r\\ndid not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed\\r\\nconversation. She was first called to observe and approve him farther,\\r\\nby a reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the\\r\\ndifference between him and his sister. It was a contrast which\\r\\nrecommended him most forcibly to her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is enough,\" said she; \"to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough.\\r\\nIt implies everything amiable. I love him already.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think you will like him,\" said Elinor, \"when you know more of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Like him!\" replied her mother with a smile. \"I feel no sentiment of\\r\\napprobation inferior to love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may esteem him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him. Her manners\\r\\nwere attaching, and soon banished his reserve. She speedily\\r\\ncomprehended all his merits; the persuasion of his regard for Elinor\\r\\nperhaps assisted her penetration; but she really felt assured of his\\r\\nworth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against all\\r\\nher established ideas of what a young man\\'s address ought to be, was\\r\\nno longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his\\r\\ntemper affectionate.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to\\r\\nElinor, than she considered their serious attachment as certain, and\\r\\nlooked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In a few months, my dear Marianne,\" said she, \"Elinor will, in all\\r\\nprobability be settled for life. We shall miss her; but _she_ will be\\r\\nhappy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Mamma, how shall we do without her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My love, it will be scarcely a separation. We shall live within a few\\r\\nmiles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives. You will\\r\\ngain a brother--a real, affectionate brother. I have the highest\\r\\nopinion in the world of Edward\\'s heart. But you look grave, Marianne;\\r\\ndo you disapprove your sister\\'s choice?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Marianne, \"I may consider it with some surprise.\\r\\nEdward is very amiable, and I love him tenderly. But yet--he is not\\r\\nthe kind of young man; there is something wanting--his figure is not\\r\\nstriking; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man\\r\\nwho could seriously attach my sister. His eyes want all that spirit,\\r\\nthat fire, which at once announce virtue and intelligence. And besides\\r\\nall this, I am afraid, Mamma, he has no real taste. Music seems\\r\\nscarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor\\'s drawings very\\r\\nmuch, it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their\\r\\nworth. It is evident, in spite of his frequent attention to her while\\r\\nshe draws, that in fact he knows nothing of the matter. He admires as\\r\\na lover, not as a connoisseur. To satisfy me, those characters must be\\r\\nunited. I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every\\r\\npoint coincide with my own. He must enter into all my feelings; the\\r\\nsame books, the same music must charm us both. Oh! mama, how\\r\\nspiritless, how tame was Edward\\'s manner in reading to us last night!\\r\\nI felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much\\r\\ncomposure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my\\r\\nseat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost\\r\\ndriven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such\\r\\ndreadful indifference!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant\\r\\nprose. I thought so at the time; but you _would_ give him Cowper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, Mamma, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!--but we must allow\\r\\nfor difference of taste. Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she\\r\\nmay overlook it, and be happy with him. But it would have broke _my_\\r\\nheart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.\\r\\nMama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I\\r\\nshall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much! He\\r\\nmust have all Edward\\'s virtues, and his person and manners must\\r\\nornament his goodness with every possible charm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen. It is yet too early in\\r\\nlife to despair of such a happiness. Why should you be less fortunate\\r\\nthan your mother? In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your\\r\\ndestiny be different from her\\'s!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a pity it is, Elinor,\" said Marianne, \"that Edward should have\\r\\nno taste for drawing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No taste for drawing!\" replied Elinor, \"why should you think so? He\\r\\ndoes not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure in seeing the\\r\\nperformances of other people, and I assure you he is by no means\\r\\ndeficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities of\\r\\nimproving it. Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he\\r\\nwould have drawn very well. He distrusts his own judgment in such\\r\\nmatters so much, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on\\r\\nany picture; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste,\\r\\nwhich in general direct him perfectly right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject; but\\r\\nthe kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by\\r\\nthe drawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous\\r\\ndelight, which, in her opinion, could alone be called taste. Yet,\\r\\nthough smiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured her sister\\r\\nfor that blind partiality to Edward which produced it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope, Marianne,\" continued Elinor, \"you do not consider him as\\r\\ndeficient in general taste. Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot,\\r\\nfor your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial, and if _that_ were\\r\\nyour opinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne hardly knew what to say. She would not wound the feelings of\\r\\nher sister on any account, and yet to say what she did not believe was\\r\\nimpossible. At length she replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him is not in every thing\\r\\nequal to your sense of his merits. I have not had so many\\r\\nopportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind, his\\r\\ninclinations and tastes, as you have; but I have the highest opinion\\r\\nin the world of his goodness and sense. I think him every thing that\\r\\nis worthy and amiable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure,\" replied Elinor, with a smile, \"that his dearest friends\\r\\ncould not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that. I do not\\r\\nperceive how you could express yourself more warmly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of his sense and his goodness,\" continued Elinor, \"no one can, I\\r\\nthink, be in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him in\\r\\nunreserved conversation. The excellence of his understanding and his\\r\\nprinciples can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps\\r\\nhim silent. You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth.\\r\\nBut of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have from\\r\\npeculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself. He and I\\r\\nhave been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been\\r\\nwholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother. I\\r\\nhave seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heard\\r\\nhis opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole,\\r\\nI venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of\\r\\nbooks exceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just\\r\\nand correct, and his taste delicate and pure. His abilities in every\\r\\nrespect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.\\r\\nAt first sight, his address is certainly not striking; and his person\\r\\ncan hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, which\\r\\nare uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, is\\r\\nperceived. At present, I know him so well, that I think him really\\r\\nhandsome; or at least, almost so. What say you, Marianne?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I do not now. When\\r\\nyou tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection\\r\\nin his face, than I now do in his heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she\\r\\nhad been betrayed into, in speaking of him. She felt that Edward stood\\r\\nvery high in her opinion. She believed the regard to be mutual; but\\r\\nshe required greater certainty of it to make Marianne\\'s conviction of\\r\\ntheir attachment agreeable to her. She knew that what Marianne and her\\r\\nmother conjectured one moment, they believed the next--that with them,\\r\\nto wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect. She tried to explain\\r\\nthe real state of the case to her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not attempt to deny,\" said she, \"that I think very highly of\\r\\nhim--that I greatly esteem, that I like him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne here burst forth with indignation--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh! worse than\\r\\ncold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise. Use those words again, and I\\r\\nwill leave the room this moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor could not help laughing. \"Excuse me,\" said she; \"and be assured\\r\\nthat I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my\\r\\nown feelings. Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;\\r\\nbelieve them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the\\r\\nsuspicion--the hope--of his affection for me may warrant, without\\r\\nimprudence or folly. But farther than this you must not believe. I am\\r\\nby no means assured of his regard for me. There are moments when the\\r\\nextent of it seems doubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known,\\r\\nyou cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own\\r\\npartiality, by believing or calling it more than it is. In my heart I\\r\\nfeel little--scarcely any doubt of his preference. But there are other\\r\\npoints to be considered besides his inclination. He is very far from\\r\\nbeing independent. What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from\\r\\nFanny\\'s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never\\r\\nbeen disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken if\\r\\nEdward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in\\r\\nhis way, if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a\\r\\ngreat fortune or high rank.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother\\r\\nand herself had outstripped the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you really are not engaged to him!\" said she. \"Yet it certainly\\r\\nsoon will happen. But two advantages will proceed from this delay. I\\r\\nshall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity\\r\\nof improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must\\r\\nbe so indispensably necessary to your future felicity. Oh! if he\\r\\nshould be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw\\r\\nhimself, how delightful it would be!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor had given her real opinion to her sister. She could not\\r\\nconsider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as\\r\\nMarianne had believed it. There was, at times, a want of spirits about\\r\\nhim which, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something\\r\\nalmost as unpromising. A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel\\r\\nit, need not give him more than inquietude. It would not be likely to\\r\\nproduce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him. A more\\r\\nreasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which\\r\\nforbade the indulgence of his affection. She knew that his mother\\r\\nneither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present,\\r\\nnor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself,\\r\\nwithout strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement. With\\r\\nsuch a knowledge as this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on\\r\\nthe subject. She was far from depending on that result of his\\r\\npreference of her, which her mother and sister still considered as\\r\\ncertain. Nay, the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed\\r\\nthe nature of his regard; and sometimes, for a few painful minutes,\\r\\nshe believed it to be no more than friendship.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when\\r\\nperceived by his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time,\\r\\n(which was still more common,) to make her uncivil. She took the first\\r\\nopportunity of affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking\\r\\nto her so expressively of her brother\\'s great expectations, of Mrs.\\r\\nFerrars\\'s resolution that both her sons should marry well, and of the\\r\\ndanger attending any young woman who attempted to _draw him in_, that\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to\\r\\nbe calm. She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, and\\r\\ninstantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the\\r\\ninconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinor\\r\\nshould not be exposed another week to such insinuations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered to her from the\\r\\npost, which contained a proposal particularly well timed. It was the\\r\\noffer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of\\r\\nher own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire. The\\r\\nletter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit\\r\\nof friendly accommodation. He understood that she was in need of a\\r\\ndwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a\\r\\ncottage, he assured her that everything should be done to it which she\\r\\nmight think necessary, if the situation pleased her. He earnestly\\r\\npressed her, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to\\r\\ncome with her daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own\\r\\nresidence, from whence she might judge, herself, whether Barton\\r\\nCottage, for the houses were in the same parish, could, by any\\r\\nalteration, be made comfortable to her. He seemed really anxious to\\r\\naccommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so\\r\\nfriendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin;\\r\\nmore especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and\\r\\nunfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections. She needed no time for\\r\\ndeliberation or inquiry. Her resolution was formed as she read. The\\r\\nsituation of Barton, in a county so far distant from Sussex as\\r\\nDevonshire, which, but a few hours before, would have been a\\r\\nsufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to\\r\\nthe place, was now its first recommendation. To quit the neighbourhood\\r\\nof Norland was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire; it was a\\r\\nblessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing her\\r\\ndaughter-in-law\\'s guest; and to remove for ever from that beloved\\r\\nplace would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a\\r\\nwoman was its mistress. She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her\\r\\nacknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal;\\r\\nand then hastened to show both letters to her daughters, that she\\r\\nmight be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle\\r\\nat some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their present\\r\\nacquaintance. On _that_ head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose\\r\\nher mother\\'s intention of removing into Devonshire. The house, too, as\\r\\ndescribed by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so\\r\\nuncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on either\\r\\npoint; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any\\r\\ncharm to her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of\\r\\nNorland beyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother\\r\\nfrom sending a letter of acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged\\r\\nherself in the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife\\r\\nthat she was provided with a house, and should incommode them no\\r\\nlonger than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it. They\\r\\nheard her with surprise. Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her\\r\\nhusband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland.\\r\\nShe had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into\\r\\nDevonshire. Edward turned hastily towards her, on hearing this, and,\\r\\nin a voice of surprise and concern, which required no explanation to\\r\\nher, repeated, \"Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from\\r\\nhence! And to what part of it?\" She explained the situation. It was\\r\\nwithin four miles northward of Exeter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is but a cottage,\" she continued, \"but I hope to see many of my\\r\\nfriends in it. A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends\\r\\nfind no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will\\r\\nfind none in accommodating them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John\\r\\nDashwood to visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still\\r\\ngreater affection. Though her late conversation with her\\r\\ndaughter-in-law had made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer\\r\\nthan was unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her\\r\\nin that point to which it principally tended. To separate Edward and\\r\\nElinor was as far from being her object as ever; and she wished to\\r\\nshow Mrs. John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother,\\r\\nhow totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly\\r\\nsorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from\\r\\nNorland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her\\r\\nfurniture. He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for\\r\\nthe very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his\\r\\npromise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.\\r\\nThe furniture was all sent around by water. It chiefly consisted of\\r\\nhousehold linen, plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte\\r\\nof Marianne\\'s. Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh:\\r\\nshe could not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood\\'s income\\r\\nwould be so trifling in comparison with their own, she should have any\\r\\nhandsome article of furniture.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready\\r\\nfurnished, and she might have immediate possession. No difficulty\\r\\narose on either side in the agreement; and she waited only for the\\r\\ndisposal of her effects at Norland, and to determine her future\\r\\nhousehold, before she set off for the west; and this, as she was\\r\\nexceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested\\r\\nher, was soon done. The horses which were left her by her husband had\\r\\nbeen sold soon after his death, and an opportunity now offering of\\r\\ndisposing of her carriage, she agreed to sell that likewise at the\\r\\nearnest advice of her eldest daughter. For the comfort of her\\r\\nchildren, had she consulted only her own wishes, she would have kept\\r\\nit; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed. _Her_ wisdom too limited\\r\\nthe number of their servants to three; two maids and a man, with whom\\r\\nthey were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their\\r\\nestablishment at Norland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into\\r\\nDevonshire, to prepare the house for their mistress\\'s arrival; for as\\r\\nLady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred\\r\\ngoing directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and\\r\\nshe relied so undoubtingly on Sir John\\'s description of the house, as\\r\\nto feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her\\r\\nown. Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from\\r\\ndiminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the\\r\\nprospect of her removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted\\r\\nto be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.\\r\\nNow was the time when her son-in-law\\'s promise to his father might\\r\\nwith particular propriety be fulfilled. Since he had neglected to do\\r\\nit on first coming to the estate, their quitting his house might be\\r\\nlooked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment. But Mrs.\\r\\nDashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind, and to be\\r\\nconvinced, from the general drift of his discourse, that his\\r\\nassistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months\\r\\nat Norland. He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of\\r\\nhousekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man\\r\\nof any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to,\\r\\nthat he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to\\r\\nhave any design of giving money away.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton\\'s\\r\\nfirst letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their\\r\\nfuture abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin\\r\\ntheir journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so\\r\\nmuch beloved. \"Dear, dear Norland!\" said Marianne, as she wandered\\r\\nalone before the house, on the last evening of their being there;\\r\\n\"when shall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home\\r\\nelsewhere! Oh! happy house, could you know what I suffer in now\\r\\nviewing you from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no\\r\\nmore! And you, ye well-known trees!--but you will continue the same.\\r\\nNo leaf will decay because we are removed, nor any branch become\\r\\nmotionless although we can observe you no longer! No; you will\\r\\ncontinue the same; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you\\r\\noccasion, and insensible of any change in those who walk under your\\r\\nshade! But who will remain to enjoy you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a\\r\\ndisposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant. But as they\\r\\ndrew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of a\\r\\ncountry which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a\\r\\nview of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness. It\\r\\nwas a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture. After\\r\\nwinding along it for more than a mile, they reached their own house. A\\r\\nsmall green court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat\\r\\nwicket gate admitted them into it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact;\\r\\nbut as a cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, the\\r\\nroof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor were\\r\\nthe walls covered with honeysuckles. A narrow passage led directly\\r\\nthrough the house into the garden behind. On each side of the entrance\\r\\nwas a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were\\r\\nthe offices and the stairs. Four bedrooms and two garrets formed the\\r\\nrest of the house. It had not been built many years and was in good\\r\\nrepair. In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but\\r\\nthe tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house\\r\\nwere soon dried away. They were cheered by the joy of the servants on\\r\\ntheir arrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear\\r\\nhappy. It was very early in September; the season was fine, and from\\r\\nfirst seeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they\\r\\nreceived an impression in its favour which was of material service in\\r\\nrecommending it to their lasting approbation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe situation of the house was good. High hills rose immediately\\r\\nbehind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were open\\r\\ndowns, the others cultivated and woody. The village of Barton was\\r\\nchiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the\\r\\ncottage windows. The prospect in front was more extensive; it\\r\\ncommanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country\\r\\nbeyond. The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley\\r\\nin that direction; under another name, and in another course, it\\r\\nbranched out again between two of the steepest of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon the\\r\\nwhole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered\\r\\nmany additions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was\\r\\na delight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to\\r\\nsupply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments. \"As\\r\\nfor the house itself, to be sure,\" said she, \"it is too small for our\\r\\nfamily, but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the\\r\\npresent, as it is too late in the year for improvements. Perhaps in\\r\\nthe spring, if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may\\r\\nthink about building. These parlors are both too small for such\\r\\nparties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I\\r\\nhave some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with\\r\\nperhaps a part of the other, and so leave the remainder of that other\\r\\nfor an entrance; this, with a new drawing room which may be easily\\r\\nadded, and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug\\r\\nlittle cottage. I could wish the stairs were handsome. But one must\\r\\nnot expect every thing; though I suppose it would be no difficult\\r\\nmatter to widen them. I shall see how much I am before-hand with the\\r\\nworld in the spring, and we will plan our improvements accordingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from the\\r\\nsavings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never\\r\\nsaved in her life, they were wise enough to be contented with the\\r\\nhouse as it was; and each of them was busy in arranging their\\r\\nparticular concerns, and endeavoring, by placing around them books and\\r\\nother possessions, to form themselves a home. Marianne\\'s pianoforte\\r\\nwas unpacked and properly disposed of; and Elinor\\'s drawings were\\r\\naffixed to the walls of their sitting room.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn such employments as these they were interrupted soon after\\r\\nbreakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord, who called\\r\\nto welcome them to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from\\r\\nhis own house and garden in which theirs might at present be\\r\\ndeficient. Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty. He\\r\\nhad formerly visited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his young\\r\\ncousins to remember him. His countenance was thoroughly good-humoured;\\r\\nand his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter. Their\\r\\narrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort to\\r\\nbe an object of real solicitude to him. He said much of his earnest\\r\\ndesire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family, and\\r\\npressed them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they\\r\\nwere better settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried\\r\\nto a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give\\r\\noffence. His kindness was not confined to words; for within an hour\\r\\nafter he left them, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit\\r\\narrived from the park, which was followed before the end of the day by\\r\\na present of game. He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their\\r\\nletters to and from the post for them, and would not be denied the\\r\\nsatisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him, denoting her\\r\\nintention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as she could be assured\\r\\nthat her visit would be no inconvenience; and as this message was\\r\\nanswered by an invitation equally polite, her ladyship was introduced\\r\\nto them the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _So shy before company._]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were, of course, very anxious to see a person on whom so much of\\r\\ntheir comfort at Barton must depend; and the elegance of her\\r\\nappearance was favourable to their wishes. Lady Middleton was not more\\r\\nthan six or seven and twenty; her face was handsome, her figure tall\\r\\nand striking, and her address graceful. Her manners had all the\\r\\nelegance which her husband\\'s wanted. But they would have been improved\\r\\nby some share of his frankness and warmth; and her visit was long\\r\\nenough to detract something from their first admiration, by showing\\r\\nthat, though perfectly well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had\\r\\nnothing to say for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or\\r\\nremark.\\r\\n\\r\\nConversation however was not wanted, for Sir John was very chatty, and\\r\\nLady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her\\r\\ntheir eldest child, a fine little boy about six years old, by which\\r\\nmeans there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in\\r\\ncase of extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age, admire\\r\\nhis beauty, and ask him questions which his mother answered for him,\\r\\nwhile he hung about her and held down his head, to the great surprise\\r\\nof her ladyship, who wondered at his being so shy before company, as\\r\\nhe could make noise enough at home. On every formal visit a child\\r\\nought to be of the party, by way of provision for discourse. In the\\r\\npresent case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were\\r\\nmost like his father or mother, and in what particular he resembled\\r\\neither, for of course every body differed, and every body was\\r\\nastonished at the opinion of the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on\\r\\nthe rest of the children, as Sir John would not leave the house\\r\\nwithout securing their promise of dining at the park the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBarton Park was about half a mile from the cottage. The ladies had\\r\\npassed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened from\\r\\ntheir view at home by the projection of a hill. The house was large\\r\\nand handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality\\r\\nand elegance. The former was for Sir John\\'s gratification, the latter\\r\\nfor that of his lady. They were scarcely ever without some friends\\r\\nstaying with them in the house, and they kept more company of every\\r\\nkind than any other family in the neighbourhood. It was necessary to\\r\\nthe happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and outward\\r\\nbehaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want of\\r\\ntalent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected with\\r\\nsuch as society produced, within a very narrow compass. Sir John was a\\r\\nsportsman, Lady Middleton a mother. He hunted and shot, and she\\r\\nhumoured her children; and these were their only resources. Lady\\r\\nMiddleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all\\r\\nthe year round, while Sir John\\'s independent employments were in\\r\\nexistence only half the time. Continual engagements at home and\\r\\nabroad, however, supplied all the deficiencies of nature and\\r\\neducation; supported the good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise\\r\\nto the good breeding of his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table, and of\\r\\nall her domestic arrangements; and from this kind of vanity was her\\r\\ngreatest enjoyment in any of their parties. But Sir John\\'s\\r\\nsatisfaction in society was much more real; he delighted in collecting\\r\\nabout him more young people than his house would hold, and the noisier\\r\\nthey were the better was he pleased. He was a blessing to all the\\r\\njuvenile part of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for ever\\r\\nforming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in\\r\\nwinter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who\\r\\nwas not suffering under the insatiable appetite of fifteen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy\\r\\nto him, and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants\\r\\nhe had now procured for his cottage at Barton. The Miss Dashwoods were\\r\\nyoung, pretty, and unaffected. It was enough to secure his good\\r\\nopinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to\\r\\nmake her mind as captivating as her person. The friendliness of his\\r\\ndisposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation\\r\\nmight be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate. In\\r\\nshowing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction\\r\\nof a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his\\r\\ncottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman,\\r\\nthough he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is\\r\\nnot often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a\\r\\nresidence within his own manor.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by\\r\\nSir John, who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity;\\r\\nand as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young\\r\\nladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day\\r\\nbefore, at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them. They\\r\\nwould see, he said, only one gentleman there besides himself; a\\r\\nparticular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither\\r\\nvery young nor very gay. He hoped they would all excuse the smallness\\r\\nof the party, and could assure them it should never happen so again.\\r\\nHe had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring\\r\\nsome addition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was\\r\\nfull of engagements. Luckily Lady Middleton\\'s mother had arrived at\\r\\nBarton within the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable\\r\\nwoman, he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as\\r\\nthey might imagine. The young ladies, as well as their mother, were\\r\\nperfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and\\r\\nwished for no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton\\'s mother, was a good-humoured, merry,\\r\\nfat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, and\\r\\nrather vulgar. She was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinner\\r\\nwas over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and\\r\\nhusbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,\\r\\nand pretended to see them blush whether they did or not. Marianne was\\r\\nvexed at it for her sister\\'s sake, and turned her eyes towards Elinor\\r\\nto see how she bore these attacks, with an earnestness which gave\\r\\nElinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place raillery\\r\\nas Mrs. Jennings\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no more adapted by\\r\\nresemblance of manner to be his friend, than Lady Middleton was to be\\r\\nhis wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton\\'s mother. He was\\r\\nsilent and grave. His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite\\r\\nof his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old\\r\\nbachelor, for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty; but though\\r\\nhis face was not handsome, his countenance was sensible, and his\\r\\naddress was particularly gentlemanlike.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as\\r\\ncompanions to the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton\\r\\nwas so particularly repulsive, that in comparison of it the gravity\\r\\nof Colonel Brandon, and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his\\r\\nmother-in-law was interesting. Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to\\r\\nenjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after\\r\\ndinner, who pulled her about, tore her clothes, and put an end to\\r\\nevery kind of discourse except what related to themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she was\\r\\ninvited to play. The instrument was unlocked, every body prepared to\\r\\nbe charmed, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request went\\r\\nthrough the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into\\r\\nthe family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since in\\r\\nthe same position on the pianoforte, for her ladyship had celebrated\\r\\nthat event by giving up music, although by her mother\\'s account, she\\r\\nhad played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne\\'s performance was highly applauded. Sir John was loud in his\\r\\nadmiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his conversation\\r\\nwith the others while every song lasted. Lady Middleton frequently\\r\\ncalled him to order, wondered how any one\\'s attention could be\\r\\ndiverted from music for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a\\r\\nparticular song which Marianne had just finished. Colonel Brandon\\r\\nalone, of all the party, heard her without being in raptures. He paid\\r\\nher only the compliment of attention; and she felt a respect for him\\r\\non the occasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their\\r\\nshameless want of taste. His pleasure in music, though it amounted not\\r\\nto that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own,\\r\\nwas estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of\\r\\nthe others; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five\\r\\nand thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every\\r\\nexquisite power of enjoyment. She was perfectly disposed to make every\\r\\nallowance for the colonel\\'s advanced state of life which humanity\\r\\nrequired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure. She had only two\\r\\ndaughters, both of whom she had lived to see respectably married, and\\r\\nshe had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the\\r\\nworld. In the promotion of this object she was zealously active, as\\r\\nfar as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity of projecting\\r\\nweddings among all the young people of her acquaintance. She was\\r\\nremarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the\\r\\nadvantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady\\r\\nby insinuations of her power over such a young man; and this kind of\\r\\ndiscernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to\\r\\npronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne\\r\\nDashwood. She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first evening\\r\\nof their being together, from his listening so attentively while she\\r\\nsang to them; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons\\'\\r\\ndining at the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his listening to\\r\\nher again. It must be so. She was perfectly convinced of it. It would\\r\\nbe an excellent match, for _he_ was rich, and _she_ was handsome. Mrs.\\r\\nJennings had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever\\r\\nsince her connection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge;\\r\\nand she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty\\r\\ngirl.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable, for\\r\\nit supplied her with endless jokes against them both. At the park she\\r\\nlaughed at the colonel, and in the cottage at Marianne. To the former\\r\\nher raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,\\r\\nperfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at first\\r\\nincomprehensible; and when its object was understood, she hardly knew\\r\\nwhether most to laugh at its absurdity, or censure its impertinence,\\r\\nfor she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel\\'s\\r\\nadvanced years, and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger than\\r\\nherself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy\\r\\nof her daughter, ventured to clear Mrs. Jennings from the probability\\r\\nof wishing to throw ridicule on his age.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But at least, Mamma, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation,\\r\\nthough you may not think it intentionally ill-natured. Colonel Brandon\\r\\nis certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be\\r\\n_my_ father; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love, must\\r\\nhave long outlived every sensation of the kind. It is too ridiculous!\\r\\nWhen is a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will not\\r\\nprotect him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Infirmity!\" said Elinor, \"do you call Colonel Brandon infirm? I can\\r\\neasily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my\\r\\nmother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use\\r\\nof his limbs!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism? and is not that the\\r\\ncommonest infirmity of declining life?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dearest child,\" said her mother, laughing, \"at this rate you must\\r\\nbe in continual terror of _my_ decay; and it must seem to you a\\r\\nmiracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mamma, you are not doing me justice. I know very well that Colonel\\r\\nBrandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of\\r\\nlosing him in the course of nature. He may live twenty years longer.\\r\\nBut thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, \"thirty-five and seventeen had better not have\\r\\nany thing to do with matrimony together. But if there should by any\\r\\nchance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I\\r\\nshould not think Colonel Brandon\\'s being thirty-five any objection to\\r\\nhis marrying _her_ .\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A woman of seven and twenty,\" said Marianne, after pausing a moment,\\r\\n\"can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home be\\r\\nuncomfortable, or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might\\r\\nbring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the\\r\\nprovision and security of a wife. In his marrying such a woman\\r\\ntherefore there would be nothing unsuitable. It would be a compact of\\r\\nconvenience, and the world would be satisfied. In my eyes it would be\\r\\nno marriage at all, but that would be nothing. To me it would seem\\r\\nonly a commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at\\r\\nthe expense of the other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would be impossible, I know,\" replied Elinor, \"to convince you\\r\\nthat a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five\\r\\nanything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to\\r\\nher. But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to\\r\\nthe constant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he chanced\\r\\nto complain yesterday (a very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic\\r\\nfeel in one of his shoulders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he talked of flannel waistcoats,\" said Marianne; \"and with me a\\r\\nflannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps,\\r\\nrheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and\\r\\nthe feeble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not have despised him\\r\\nhalf so much. Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting to\\r\\nyou in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after this, upon Elinor\\'s leaving the room, \"Mamma,\" said\\r\\nMarianne, \"I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannot\\r\\nconceal from you. I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well. We have now\\r\\nbeen here almost a fortnight, and yet he does not come. Nothing but\\r\\nreal indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay. What else\\r\\ncan detain him at Norland?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had you any idea of his coming so soon?\" said Mrs. Dashwood. \"I had\\r\\nnone. On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on the\\r\\nsubject, it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want\\r\\nof pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of\\r\\nhis coming to Barton. Does Elinor expect him already?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have never mentioned it to her, but of course she must.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I rather think you are mistaken, for when I was talking to her\\r\\nyesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bed-chamber, she\\r\\nobserved that there was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not\\r\\nlikely that the room would be wanted for some time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it! But the whole of\\r\\ntheir behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! How cold, how\\r\\ncomposed were their last adieus! How languid their conversation the\\r\\nlast evening of their being together! In Edward\\'s farewell there was\\r\\nno distinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes of an\\r\\naffectionate brother to both. Twice did I leave them purposely\\r\\ntogether in the course of the last morning, and each time did he most\\r\\nunaccountably follow me out of the room. And Elinor, in quitting\\r\\nNorland and Edward, cried not as I did. Even now her self-command is\\r\\ninvariable. When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try to\\r\\navoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to\\r\\nthemselves. The house and the garden, with all the objects surrounding\\r\\nthem, were now become familiar, and the ordinary pursuits which had\\r\\ngiven to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far\\r\\ngreater enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the loss\\r\\nof their father. Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for\\r\\nthe first fortnight, and who was not in the habit of seeing much\\r\\noccupation at home, could not conceal his amazement on finding them\\r\\nalways employed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, in\\r\\nspite of Sir John\\'s urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the\\r\\nneighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at\\r\\ntheir service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwood\\'s spirit overcame the\\r\\nwish of society for her children; and she was resolute in declining to\\r\\nvisit any family beyond the distance of a walk. There were but few who\\r\\ncould be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable.\\r\\nAbout a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow winding\\r\\nvalley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerly\\r\\ndescribed, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered\\r\\nan ancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a\\r\\nlittle of Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to\\r\\nbe better acquainted with it. But they learnt, on enquiry, that its\\r\\npossessor, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunately\\r\\ntoo infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks. The high\\r\\ndowns which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to\\r\\nseek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happy\\r\\nalternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their\\r\\nsuperior beauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and\\r\\nMargaret one memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the\\r\\npartial sunshine of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the\\r\\nconfinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had\\r\\noccasioned. The weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others\\r\\nfrom their pencil and their book, in spite of Marianne\\'s declaration\\r\\nthat the day would be lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud\\r\\nwould be drawn off from their hills; and the two girls set off\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at\\r\\nevery glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces the\\r\\nanimating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears\\r\\nwhich had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such\\r\\ndelightful sensations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is there a felicity in the world,\" said Marianne, \"superior to\\r\\nthis?--Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMargaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind,\\r\\nresisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer,\\r\\nwhen suddenly the clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain\\r\\nset full in their face. Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged,\\r\\nthough unwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their\\r\\nown house. One consolation however remained for them, to which the\\r\\nexigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety,--it was that of\\r\\nrunning with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which\\r\\nled immediately to their garden gate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey set off. Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false step\\r\\nbrought her suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stop\\r\\nherself to assist her, was involuntarily hurried along, and reached\\r\\nthe bottom in safety.\\r\\n\\r\\nA gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, was\\r\\npassing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when her\\r\\naccident happened. He put down his gun and ran to her assistance. She\\r\\nhad raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been twisted in\\r\\nher fall, and she was scarcely able to stand. The gentleman offered\\r\\nhis services; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her\\r\\nsituation rendered necessary, took her up in his arms without farther\\r\\ndelay, and carried her down the hill. Then passing through the garden,\\r\\nthe gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directly\\r\\ninto the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his\\r\\nhold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and\\r\\nwhile the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a\\r\\nsecret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he\\r\\napologized for his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so\\r\\nfrank and so graceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome,\\r\\nreceived additional charms from his voice and expression. Had he been\\r\\neven old, ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs.\\r\\nDashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child;\\r\\nbut the influence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to\\r\\nthe action which came home to her feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness of address\\r\\nwhich always attended her, invited him to be seated. But this he\\r\\ndeclined, as he was dirty and wet. Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know\\r\\nto whom she was obliged. His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his\\r\\npresent home was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would allow him\\r\\nthe honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood. The\\r\\nhonour was readily granted, and he then departed, to make himself\\r\\nstill more interesting, in the midst of a heavy rain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the\\r\\ntheme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raised\\r\\nagainst Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior\\r\\nattractions. Marianne herself had seen less of his person than the\\r\\nrest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his lifting\\r\\nher up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their\\r\\nentering the house. But she had seen enough of him to join in all the\\r\\nadmiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned her\\r\\npraise. His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn\\r\\nfor the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into the\\r\\nhouse with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of\\r\\nthought which particularly recommended the action to her. Every\\r\\ncircumstance belonging to him was interesting. His name was good, his\\r\\nresidence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out that\\r\\nof all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming. Her\\r\\nimagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of a\\r\\nsprained ankle was disregarded.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather\\r\\nthat morning allowed him to get out of doors; and Marianne\\'s accident\\r\\nbeing related to him, he was eagerly asked whether he knew any\\r\\ngentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Willoughby!\" cried Sir John; \"what, is _he_ in the country? That is\\r\\ngood news however; I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on\\r\\nThursday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know him then,\" said Mrs. Dashwood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Know him! to be sure I do. Why, he is down here every year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what sort of a young man is he?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you. A very decent\\r\\nshot, and there is not a bolder rider in England.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is that all you can say for him?\" cried Marianne, indignantly.\\r\\n\"But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance? What his\\r\\npursuits, his talents, and genius?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir John was rather puzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my soul,\" said he, \"I do not know much about him as to all\\r\\n_that._ But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the\\r\\nnicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw. Was she out with\\r\\nhim today?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr.\\r\\nWilloughby\\'s pointer, than he could describe to her the shades of his\\r\\nmind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But who is he?\" said Elinor. \"Where does he come from? Has he a house\\r\\nat Allenham?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence; and he\\r\\ntold them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the\\r\\ncountry; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady\\r\\nat Allenham Court, to whom he was related, and whose possessions he\\r\\nwas to inherit; adding, \"Yes, yes, he is very well worth catching I\\r\\ncan tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty little estate of his own\\r\\nin Somersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him up\\r\\nto my younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills. Miss\\r\\nMarianne must not expect to have all the men to herself. Brandon will\\r\\nbe jealous, if she does not take care.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, with a good humoured smile,\\r\\n\"that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of\\r\\n_my_ daughters towards what you call _catching him._ It is not an\\r\\nemployment to which they have been brought up. Men are very safe with\\r\\nus, let them be ever so rich. I am glad to find, however, from what\\r\\nyou say, that he is a respectable young man, and one whose\\r\\nacquaintance will not be ineligible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived,\" repeated\\r\\nSir John. \"I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he\\r\\ndanced from eight o\\'clock till four, without once sitting down.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did he indeed?\" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes, \"and with\\r\\nelegance, with spirit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be. Whatever\\r\\nbe his pursuits, his eagerness in them should know no moderation, and\\r\\nleave him no sense of fatigue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, I see how it will be,\" said Sir John, \"I see how it will\\r\\nbe. You will be setting your cap at him now, and never think of poor\\r\\nBrandon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is an expression, Sir John,\" said Marianne, warmly, \"which I\\r\\nparticularly dislike. I abhor every common-place phrase by which wit\\r\\nis intended; and \\'setting one\\'s cap at a man,\\' or \\'making a conquest,\\'\\r\\nare the most odious of all. Their tendency is gross and illiberal; and\\r\\nif their construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long ago\\r\\ndestroyed all its ingenuity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir John did not much understand this reproof; but he laughed as\\r\\nheartily as if he did, and then replied--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say, one way or other.\\r\\nPoor Brandon! he is quite smitten already, and he is very well worth\\r\\nsetting your cap at, I can tell you, in spite of all this tumbling\\r\\nabout and spraining of ankles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne\\'s preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision,\\r\\nstyled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to\\r\\nmake his personal enquiries. He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with\\r\\nmore than politeness; with a kindness which Sir John\\'s account of him\\r\\nand her own gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during the\\r\\nvisit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance, mutual affection,\\r\\nand domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced\\r\\nhim. Of their personal charms he had not required a second interview\\r\\nto be convinced.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and a\\r\\nremarkably pretty figure. Marianne was still handsomer. Her form,\\r\\nthough not so correct as her sister\\'s, in having the advantage of\\r\\nheight, was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when in\\r\\nthe common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl, truth was\\r\\nless violently outraged than usually happens. Her skin was very brown,\\r\\nbut, from its transparency, her complexion was uncommonly brilliant;\\r\\nher features were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive; and in\\r\\nher eyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an\\r\\neagerness, which could hardily be seen without delight. From\\r\\nWilloughby their expression was at first held back, by the\\r\\nembarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created. But\\r\\nwhen this passed away, when her spirits became collected, when she saw\\r\\nthat to the perfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united\\r\\nfrankness and vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare,\\r\\nthat of music and dancing he was passionately fond, she gave him such\\r\\na look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to\\r\\nherself for the rest of his stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her\\r\\nto talk. She could not be silent when such points were introduced, and\\r\\nshe had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion. They speedily\\r\\ndiscovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, and\\r\\nthat it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that\\r\\nrelated to either. Encouraged by this to a further examination of his\\r\\nopinions, she proceeded to question him on the subject of books; her\\r\\nfavourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so\\r\\nrapturous a delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have\\r\\nbeen insensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the\\r\\nexcellence of such works, however disregarded before. Their taste was\\r\\nstrikingly alike. The same books, the same passages were idolized by\\r\\neach; or if any difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no\\r\\nlonger than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her\\r\\neyes could be displayed. He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught\\r\\nall her enthusiasm; and long before his visit concluded, they\\r\\nconversed with the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Marianne,\" said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, \"for _one_\\r\\nmorning I think you have done pretty well. You have already\\r\\nascertained Mr. Willoughby\\'s opinion in almost every matter of\\r\\nimportance. You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are\\r\\ncertain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and you have\\r\\nreceived every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.\\r\\nBut how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such\\r\\nextraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse? You will soon\\r\\nhave exhausted each favourite topic. Another meeting will suffice to\\r\\nexplain his sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second marriages,\\r\\nand then you can have nothing farther to ask.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Elinor,\" cried Marianne, \"is this fair? is this just? are my ideas so\\r\\nscanty? But I see what you mean. I have been too much at my ease, too\\r\\nhappy, too frank. I have erred against every common-place notion of\\r\\ndecorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been\\r\\nreserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful:--had I talked only of the\\r\\nweather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this\\r\\nreproach would have been spared.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My love,\" said her mother, \"you must not be offended with Elinor--she\\r\\nwas only in jest. I should scold her myself, if she were capable of\\r\\nwishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new\\r\\nfriend.\" Marianne was softened in a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilloughby, on his side, gave every proof of his pleasure in their\\r\\nacquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer. He\\r\\ncame to them every day. To enquire after Marianne was at first his\\r\\nexcuse; but the encouragement of his reception, to which every day\\r\\ngave greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had\\r\\nceased to be possible, by Marianne\\'s perfect recovery. She was\\r\\nconfined for some days to the house; but never had any confinement\\r\\nbeen less irksome. Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quick\\r\\nimagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners. He was\\r\\nexactly formed to engage Marianne\\'s heart, for with all this, he\\r\\njoined not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind\\r\\nwhich was now roused and increased by the example of her own, and\\r\\nwhich recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment. They read,\\r\\nthey talked, they sang together; his musical talents were\\r\\nconsiderable; and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which\\r\\nEdward had unfortunately wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Mrs. Dashwood\\'s estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne\\'s;\\r\\nand Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which he\\r\\nstrongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying too\\r\\nmuch what he thought on every occasion, without attention to persons\\r\\nor circumstances. In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other\\r\\npeople, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of\\r\\nundivided attention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too\\r\\neasily the forms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of caution\\r\\nwhich Elinor could not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne\\r\\ncould say in its support.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized\\r\\nher at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her\\r\\nideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable. Willoughby was\\r\\nall that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every\\r\\nbrighter period, as capable of attaching her; and his behaviour\\r\\ndeclared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilities\\r\\nwere strong.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _They sang together._]\\r\\n\\r\\nHer mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of their\\r\\nmarriage had been raised, by his prospect of riches, was led before\\r\\nthe end of a week to hope and expect it; and secretly to congratulate\\r\\nherself on having gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and\\r\\nWilloughby.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Brandon\\'s partiality for Marianne, which had so\\r\\nearly been discovered by his friends, now first became perceptible to\\r\\nElinor, when it ceased to be noticed by them. Their attention and wit\\r\\nwere drawn off to his more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the\\r\\nother had incurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his\\r\\nfeelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to\\r\\nsensibility. Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that\\r\\nthe sentiments which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own\\r\\nsatisfaction, were now actually excited by her sister; and that\\r\\nhowever a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might\\r\\nforward the affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally striking\\r\\nopposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of Colonel\\r\\nBrandon. She saw it with concern; for what could a silent man of five\\r\\nand thirty hope, when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty?\\r\\nand as she could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished him\\r\\nindifferent. She liked him--in spite of his gravity and reserve, she\\r\\nbeheld in him an object of interest. His manners, though serious, were\\r\\nmild; and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of\\r\\nspirits than of any natural gloominess of temper. Sir John had dropped\\r\\nhints of past injuries and disappointments, which justified her belief\\r\\nof his being an unfortunate man, and she regarded him with respect and\\r\\ncompassion.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted\\r\\nby Willoughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for being\\r\\nneither lively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Brandon is just the kind of man,\" said Willoughby one day, when they\\r\\nwere talking of him together, \"whom every body speaks well of, and\\r\\nnobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody\\r\\nremembers to talk to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is exactly what I think of him,\" cried Marianne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not boast of it, however,\" said Elinor, \"for it is injustice in\\r\\nboth of you. He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, and\\r\\nI never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That he is patronised by _you_,\" replied Willoughby, \"is certainly in\\r\\nhis favour; but as for the esteem of the others, it is a reproach in\\r\\nitself. Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a\\r\\nwoman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command the\\r\\nindifference of any body else?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will\\r\\nmake amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother. If their\\r\\npraise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not more\\r\\nundiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In defence of your _protege_ you can even be saucy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My _protege_, as you call him, is a sensible man; and sense will\\r\\nalways have attractions for me. Yes, Marianne, even in a man between\\r\\nthirty and forty. He has seen a great deal of the world; has been\\r\\nabroad, has read, and has a thinking mind. I have found him capable of\\r\\ngiving me much information on various subjects; and he has always\\r\\nanswered my inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good\\r\\nnature.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is to say,\" cried Marianne contemptuously, \"he has told you,\\r\\nthat in the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are\\r\\ntroublesome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He _would_ have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such\\r\\ninquiries, but they happened to be points on which I had been\\r\\npreviously informed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Willoughby, \"his observations may have extended to the\\r\\nexistence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I may venture to say that _his_ observations have stretched much\\r\\nfurther than _your_ candour. But why should you dislike him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not dislike him. I consider him, on the contrary, as a very\\r\\nrespectable man, who has every body\\'s good word, and nobody\\'s notice;\\r\\nwho, has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how to\\r\\nemploy, and two new coats every year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Add to which,\" cried Marianne, \"that he has neither genius, taste,\\r\\nnor spirit. That his understanding has no brilliancy, his feelings no\\r\\nardour, and his voice no expression.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass,\" replied Elinor,\\r\\n\"and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the\\r\\ncommendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and\\r\\ninsipid. I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred,\\r\\nwell-informed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an\\r\\namiable heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Dashwood,\" cried Willoughby, \"you are now using me unkindly. You\\r\\nare endeavouring to disarm me by reason, and to convince me against my\\r\\nwill. But it will not do. You shall find me as stubborn as you can be\\r\\nartful. I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel\\r\\nBrandon; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he\\r\\nhas found fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade\\r\\nhim to buy my brown mare. If it will be any satisfaction to you,\\r\\nhowever, to be told, that I believe his character to be in other\\r\\nrespects irreproachable, I am ready to confess it. And in return for\\r\\nan acknowledgment, which must give me some pain, you cannot deny me\\r\\nthe privilege of disliking him as much as ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first\\r\\ncame into Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy\\r\\ntheir time as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have\\r\\nsuch frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them\\r\\nlittle leisure for serious employment. Yet such was the case. When\\r\\nMarianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad,\\r\\nwhich Sir John had been previously forming, were put into execution.\\r\\nThe private balls at the park then began; and parties on the water\\r\\nwere made and accomplished as often as a showery October would allow.\\r\\nIn every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and\\r\\nfamiliarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly\\r\\ncalculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the\\r\\nDashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of\\r\\nMarianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,\\r\\nin her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of her\\r\\naffection.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor could not be surprised at their attachment. She only wished\\r\\nthat it were less openly shown; and once or twice did venture to\\r\\nsuggest the propriety of some self-command to Marianne. But Marianne\\r\\nabhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend\\r\\nunreserve; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in\\r\\nthemselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely an unnecessary\\r\\neffort, but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and\\r\\nmistaken notions. Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at\\r\\nall times, was an illustration of their opinions.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he was present she had no eyes for any one else. Every thing he\\r\\ndid, was right. Every thing he said, was clever. If their evenings at\\r\\nthe park were concluded with cards, he cheated himself and all the\\r\\nrest of the party to get her a good hand. If dancing formed the\\r\\namusement of the night, they were partners for half the time; and when\\r\\nobliged to separate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand\\r\\ntogether and scarcely spoke a word to any body else. Such conduct made\\r\\nthem of course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not\\r\\nshame, and seemed hardly to provoke them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left\\r\\nher no inclination for checking this excessive display of them. To her\\r\\nit was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young\\r\\nand ardent mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the season of happiness to Marianne. Her heart was devoted to\\r\\nWilloughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she brought with\\r\\nher from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she had thought\\r\\nit possible before, by the charms which his society bestowed on her\\r\\npresent home.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor\\'s happiness was not so great. Her heart was not so much at\\r\\nease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure. They afforded\\r\\nher no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind,\\r\\nnor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than\\r\\never. Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the\\r\\nconversation she missed; although the latter was an everlasting\\r\\ntalker, and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which\\r\\nensured her a large share of her discourse. She had already repeated\\r\\nher own history to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor\\'s memory\\r\\nbeen equal to her means of improvement, she might have known very\\r\\nearly in their acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jennings\\'s last\\r\\nillness, and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died.\\r\\nLady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more\\r\\nsilent. Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve\\r\\nwas a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do.\\r\\nTowards her husband and mother she was the same as to them; and\\r\\nintimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired. She had\\r\\nnothing to say one day that she had not said the day before. Her\\r\\ninsipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were always the same;\\r\\nand though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband,\\r\\nprovided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest\\r\\nchildren attended her, she never appeared to receive more enjoyment\\r\\nfrom them than she might have experienced in sitting at home; and so\\r\\nlittle did her presence add to the pleasure of the others, by any\\r\\nshare in their conversation, that they were sometimes only reminded of\\r\\nher being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor find\\r\\na person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities,\\r\\nexcite the interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion.\\r\\nWilloughby was out of the question. Her admiration and regard, even\\r\\nher sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover; his\\r\\nattentions were wholly Marianne\\'s, and a far less agreeable man might\\r\\nhave been more generally pleasing. Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for\\r\\nhimself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in\\r\\nconversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the\\r\\nindifference of her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor\\'s compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspect\\r\\nthat the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him.\\r\\nThis suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from\\r\\nhim one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together by\\r\\nmutual consent, while the others were dancing. His eyes were fixed on\\r\\nMarianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with a faint\\r\\nsmile, \"Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second\\r\\nattachments.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Elinor, \"her opinions are all romantic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible to exist.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe she does. But how she contrives it without reflecting on\\r\\nthe character of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know\\r\\nnot. A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable\\r\\nbasis of common sense and observation; and then they may be more easy\\r\\nto define and to justify than they now are, by any body but herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This will probably be the case,\" he replied; \"and yet there is\\r\\nsomething so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is\\r\\nsorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot agree with you there,\" said Elinor. \"There are\\r\\ninconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne\\'s, which all the\\r\\ncharms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for. Her\\r\\nsystems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at\\r\\nnought; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look\\r\\nforward to as her greatest possible advantage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a\\r\\nsecond attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body? Are those\\r\\nwho have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the\\r\\ninconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be\\r\\nequally indifferent during the rest of their lives?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles.\\r\\nI only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second\\r\\nattachment\\'s being pardonable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This,\" said he, \"cannot hold; but a change, a total change of\\r\\nsentiments--No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic\\r\\nrefinements of a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently\\r\\nare they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too\\r\\ndangerous! I speak from experience. I once knew a lady who in temper\\r\\nand mind greatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like\\r\\nher, but who from an enforced change--from a series of unfortunate\\r\\ncircumstances--\" Here he stopped suddenly; appeared to think that he\\r\\nhad said too much, and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures,\\r\\nwhich might not otherwise have entered Elinor\\'s head. The lady would\\r\\nprobably have passed without suspicion, had he not convinced Miss\\r\\nDashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips. As it\\r\\nwas, it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion\\r\\nwith the tender recollection of past regard. Elinor attempted no more.\\r\\nBut Marianne, in her place, would not have done so little. The whole\\r\\nstory would have been speedily formed under her active imagination;\\r\\nand every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous\\r\\nlove.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the\\r\\nlatter communicated a piece of news to her sister, which in spite of\\r\\nall that she knew before of Marianne\\'s imprudence and want of thought,\\r\\nsurprised her by its extravagant testimony of both. Marianne told her,\\r\\nwith the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse, one\\r\\nthat he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was\\r\\nexactly calculated to carry a woman. Without considering that it was\\r\\nnot in her mother\\'s plan to keep any horse, that if she were to alter\\r\\nher resolution in favour of this gift, she must buy another for the\\r\\nservant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable\\r\\nto receive them, she had accepted the present without hesitation, and\\r\\ntold her sister of it in raptures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it,\"\\r\\nshe added, \"and when it arrives we will ride every day. You shall\\r\\nshare its use with me. Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the\\r\\ndelight of a gallop on some of these downs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMost unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to\\r\\ncomprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and for\\r\\nsome time she refused to submit to them. As to an additional servant,\\r\\nthe expense would be a trifle; Mamma she was sure would never object\\r\\nto it; and any horse would do for _him_; he might always get one at\\r\\nthe park; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient. Elinor\\r\\nthen ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present\\r\\nfrom a man so little, or at least so lately known to her. This was too\\r\\nmuch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are mistaken, Elinor,\" said she warmly, \"in supposing I know very\\r\\nlittle of Willoughby. I have not known him long indeed, but I am much\\r\\nbetter acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature in the\\r\\nworld, except yourself and mama. It is not time or opportunity that is\\r\\nto determine intimacy; it is disposition alone. Seven years would be\\r\\ninsufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven\\r\\ndays are more than enough for others. I should hold myself guilty of\\r\\ngreater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from\\r\\nWilloughby. Of John I know very little, though we have lived together\\r\\nfor years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more. She knew her\\r\\nsister\\'s temper. Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach\\r\\nher the more to her own opinion. But by an appeal to her affection for\\r\\nher mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent\\r\\nmother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) she\\r\\nconsented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly\\r\\nsubdued; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent\\r\\nkindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw\\r\\nhim next, that it must be declined.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the\\r\\ncottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to\\r\\nhim in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his\\r\\npresent. The reasons for this alteration were at the same time\\r\\nrelated, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side\\r\\nimpossible. His concern however was very apparent; and after\\r\\nexpressing it with earnestness, he added, in the same low voice, \"But,\\r\\nMarianne, the horse is still yours, though you cannot use it now. I\\r\\nshall keep it only till you can claim it. When you leave Barton to\\r\\nform your own establishment in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shall\\r\\nreceive you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of the\\r\\nsentence, in his manner of pronouncing it, and in his addressing her\\r\\nsister by her Christian name alone, she instantly saw an intimacy so\\r\\ndecided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between\\r\\nthem. From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each\\r\\nother; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she,\\r\\nor any of their friends, should be left by tempers so frank, to\\r\\ndiscover it by accident.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargaret related something to her the next day, which placed this\\r\\nmatter in a still clearer light. Willoughby had spent the preceding\\r\\nevening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the\\r\\nparlour with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity for\\r\\nobservations, which, with a most important face, she communicated to\\r\\nher eldest sister, when they were next by themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Elinor!\" she cried, \"I have such a secret to tell you about\\r\\nMarianne. I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have said so,\" replied Elinor, \"almost every day since they first\\r\\nmet on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, I\\r\\nbelieve, before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round\\r\\nher neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great\\r\\nuncle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But indeed this is quite another thing. I am sure they will be\\r\\nmarried very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take care, Margaret. It may be only the hair of some great uncle of\\r\\n_his_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne\\'s. I am almost sure it is, for I\\r\\nsaw him cut it off. Last night after tea, when you and mama went out\\r\\nof the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as\\r\\ncould be, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently\\r\\nhe took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it\\r\\nwas all tumbled down her back; and he kissed it, and folded it up in a\\r\\npiece of white paper; and put it into his pocket-book.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could not\\r\\nwithhold her credit; nor was she disposed to it, for the circumstance\\r\\nwas in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargaret\\'s sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory\\r\\nto her sister. When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the\\r\\npark, to give the name of the young man who was Elinor\\'s particular\\r\\nfavourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,\\r\\nMargaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying, \"I must not\\r\\ntell, may I, Elinor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too.\\r\\nBut the effort was painful. She was convinced that Margaret had fixed\\r\\non a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a\\r\\nstanding joke with Mrs. Jennings.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _He cut off a long lock of her hair._]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did more harm than good\\r\\nto the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to\\r\\nMargaret--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right to\\r\\nrepeat them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never had any conjectures about it,\" replied Margaret; \"it was you\\r\\nwho told me of it yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret was eagerly\\r\\npressed to say something more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nJennings. \"What is the gentleman\\'s name?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must not tell, ma\\'am. But I know very well what it is; and I know\\r\\nwhere he is too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house at Norland to be\\r\\nsure. He is the curate of the parish I dare say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, _that_ he is not. He is of no profession at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Margaret,\" said Marianne with great warmth, \"you know that all this\\r\\nis an invention of your own, and that there is no such person in\\r\\nexistence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I am sure there was such\\r\\na man once, and his name begins with an F.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMost grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at this\\r\\nmoment, \"that it rained very hard,\" though she believed the\\r\\ninterruption to proceed less from any attention to her, than from her\\r\\nladyship\\'s great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as\\r\\ndelighted her husband and mother. The idea however started by her, was\\r\\nimmediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasion\\r\\nmindful of the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject of\\r\\nrain by both of them. Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked\\r\\nMarianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours of\\r\\ndifferent people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground. But not so\\r\\neasily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her.\\r\\n\\r\\nA party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see\\r\\na very fine place about twelve miles from Barton, belonging to a\\r\\nbrother-in-law of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it could not\\r\\nbe seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict\\r\\norders on that head. The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful,\\r\\nand Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be\\r\\nallowed to be a tolerable judge, for he had formed parties to visit\\r\\nthem, at least, twice every summer for the last ten years. They\\r\\ncontained a noble piece of water--a sail on which was to a form a\\r\\ngreat part of the morning\\'s amusement; cold provisions were to be\\r\\ntaken, open carriages only to be employed, and every thing conducted\\r\\nin the usual style of a complete party of pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking,\\r\\nconsidering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for the\\r\\nlast fortnight; and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was\\r\\npersuaded by Elinor to stay at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from\\r\\nwhat Elinor had expected. She was prepared to be wet through,\\r\\nfatigued, and frightened; but the event was still more unfortunate,\\r\\nfor they did not go at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy ten o\\'clock the whole party was assembled at the park, where they\\r\\nwere to breakfast. The morning was rather favourable, though it had\\r\\nrained all night, as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,\\r\\nand the sun frequently appeared. They were all in high spirits and\\r\\ngood humour, eager to be happy, and determined to submit to the\\r\\ngreatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile they were at breakfast the letters were brought in. Among the\\r\\nrest there was one for Colonel Brandon:--he took it, looked at the\\r\\ndirection, changed colour, and immediately left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter with Brandon?\" said Sir John.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody could tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope he has had no bad news,\" said Lady Middleton. \"It must be\\r\\nsomething extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my\\r\\nbreakfast table so suddenly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn about five minutes he returned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No bad news, Colonel, I hope;\" said Mrs. Jennings, as soon as he\\r\\nentered the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None at all, ma\\'am, I thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was it from Avignon? I hope it is not to say that your sister is\\r\\nworse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am. It came from town, and is merely a letter of business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a\\r\\nletter of business? Come, come, this won\\'t do, Colonel; so let us hear\\r\\nthe truth of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear madam,\" said Lady Middleton, \"recollect what you are saying.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married?\" said\\r\\nMrs. Jennings, without attending to her daughter\\'s reproof.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, it is not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel. And I hope she is well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whom do you mean, ma\\'am?\" said he, colouring a little.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you know who I mean.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am particularly sorry, ma\\'am,\" said he, addressing Lady Middleton,\\r\\n\"that I should receive this letter today, for it is on business which\\r\\nrequires my immediate attendance in town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In town!\" cried Mrs. Jennings. \"What can you have to do in town at\\r\\nthis time of year?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My own loss is great,\" he continued, \"in being obliged to leave so\\r\\nagreeable a party; but I am the more concerned, as I fear my presence\\r\\nis necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a blow upon them all was this!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if you write a note to the housekeeper, Mr. Brandon,\" said\\r\\nMarianne, eagerly, \"will it not be sufficient?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must go,\" said Sir John. \"It shall not be put off when we are so\\r\\nnear it. You cannot go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish it could be so easily settled. But it is not in my power to\\r\\ndelay my journey for one day!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you would but let us know what your business is,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nJennings, \"we might see whether it could be put off or not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You would not be six hours later,\" said Willoughby, \"if you were to\\r\\ndefer your journey till our return.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot afford to lose _one_ hour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne, \"There\\r\\nare some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure. Brandon is one of\\r\\nthem. He was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented this\\r\\ntrick for getting out of it. I would lay fifty guineas the letter was\\r\\nof his own writing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" replied Marianne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know of\\r\\nold,\" said Sir John, \"when once you are determined on anything. But,\\r\\nhowever, I hope you will think better of it. Consider, here are the\\r\\ntwo Miss Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods walked\\r\\nup from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his\\r\\nusual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of\\r\\ndisappointing the party; but at the same time declared it to be\\r\\nunavoidable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, when will you come back again?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope we shall see you at Barton,\" added her ladyship, \"as soon as\\r\\nyou can conveniently leave town; and we must put off the party to\\r\\nWhitwell till you return.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very obliging. But it is so uncertain, when I may have it in\\r\\nmy power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! he must and shall come back,\" cried Sir John. \"If he is not here\\r\\nby the end of the week, I shall go after him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, so do, Sir John,\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"and then perhaps you may\\r\\nfind out what his business is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not want to pry into other men\\'s concerns. I suppose it is\\r\\nsomething he is ashamed of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Brandon\\'s horses were announced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do not go to town on horseback, do you?\" added Sir John.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. Only to Honiton. I shall then go post.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you a good journey. But you\\r\\nhad better change your mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I assure you it is not in my power.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then took leave of the whole party.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this\\r\\nwinter, Miss Dashwood?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid, none at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to\\r\\ndo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Marianne, he merely bowed and said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come Colonel,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"before you go, do let us know\\r\\nwhat you are going about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wished her a good morning, and, attended by Sir John, left the\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto\\r\\nrestrained, now burst forth universally; and they all agreed again and\\r\\nagain how provoking it was to be so disappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can guess what his business is, however,\" said Mrs. Jennings\\r\\nexultingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you, ma\\'am?\" said almost every body.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And who is Miss Williams?\" asked Marianne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must have\\r\\nheard of her before. She is a relation of the Colonel\\'s, my dear; a\\r\\nvery near relation. We will not say how near, for fear of shocking the\\r\\nyoung ladies.\" Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,\\r\\n\"She is his natural daughter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare. I dare say the Colonel\\r\\nwill leave her all his fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Sir John returned, he joined most heartily in the general regret\\r\\non so unfortunate an event; concluding however by observing, that as\\r\\nthey were all got together, they must do something by way of being\\r\\nhappy; and after some consultation it was agreed, that although\\r\\nhappiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure a\\r\\ntolerable composure of mind by driving about the country. The\\r\\ncarriages were then ordered; Willoughby\\'s was first, and Marianne\\r\\nnever looked happier than when she got into it. He drove through the\\r\\npark very fast, and they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of\\r\\nthem was seen till their return, which did not happen till after the\\r\\nreturn of all the rest. They both seemed delighted with their drive;\\r\\nbut said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes, while\\r\\nthe others went on the downs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was settled that there should be a dance in the evening, and that\\r\\nevery body should be extremely merry all day long. Some more of the\\r\\nCareys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down\\r\\nnearly twenty to table, which Sir John observed with great\\r\\ncontentment. Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder\\r\\nMiss Dashwoods. Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor\\'s right hand; and they had\\r\\nnot been long seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and\\r\\nsaid to Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear, \"I have found you\\r\\nout in spite of all your tricks. I know where you spent the morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne coloured, and replied very hastily, \"Where, pray?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did not you know,\" said Willoughby, \"that we had been out in my\\r\\ncurricle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well, and I was determined\\r\\nto find out _where_ you had been to. I hope you like your house, Miss\\r\\nMarianne. It is a very large one, I know; and when I come to see you,\\r\\nI hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much when\\r\\nI was there six years ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne turned away in great confusion. Mrs. Jennings laughed\\r\\nheartily; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they\\r\\nhad been, she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr.\\r\\nWilloughby\\'s groom; and that she had by that method been informed that\\r\\nthey had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there in\\r\\nwalking about the garden and going all over the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very\\r\\nunlikely that Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter\\r\\nthe house while Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the\\r\\nsmallest acquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her about it;\\r\\nand great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance\\r\\nrelated by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true. Marianne was quite angry\\r\\nwith her for doubting it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that we\\r\\ndid not see the house? Is not it what you have often wished to do\\r\\nyourself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there, and\\r\\nwith no other companion than Mr. Willoughby.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: \"_I have found you out in spite of all your tricks._\"]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to\\r\\nshow that house; and as he went in an open carriage, it was\\r\\nimpossible to have any other companion. I never spent a pleasanter\\r\\nmorning in my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid,\" replied Elinor, \"that the pleasantness of an employment\\r\\ndoes not always evince its propriety.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor; for\\r\\nif there had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have\\r\\nbeen sensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are acting\\r\\nwrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some very\\r\\nimpertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of\\r\\nyour own conduct?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of\\r\\nimpropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our\\r\\nlives. I value not her censure any more than I should do her\\r\\ncommendation. I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in\\r\\nwalking over Mrs. Smith\\'s grounds, or in seeing her house. They will\\r\\none day be Mr. Willoughby\\'s, and--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If they were one day to be your own, Marianne, you would not be\\r\\njustified in what you have done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly gratifying to her;\\r\\nand after a ten minutes\\' interval of earnest thought, she came to her\\r\\nsister again, and said with great good humour, \"Perhaps, Elinor, it\\r\\n_was_ rather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby\\r\\nwanted particularly to show me the place; and it is a charming house,\\r\\nI assure you. There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs;\\r\\nof a nice comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture\\r\\nit would be delightful. It is a corner room, and has windows on two\\r\\nsides. On one side you look across the bowling-green, behind the\\r\\nhouse, to a beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view\\r\\nof the church and village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills\\r\\nthat we have so often admired. I did not see it to advantage, for\\r\\nnothing could be more forlorn than the furniture; but if it were newly\\r\\nfitted up--a couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it\\r\\none of the pleasantest summer-rooms in England.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCould Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the\\r\\nothers, she would have described every room in the house with equal\\r\\ndelight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sudden termination of Colonel Brandon\\'s visit at the park, with\\r\\nhis steadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised\\r\\nthe wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she was a great\\r\\nwonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all\\r\\nthe comings and goings of all their acquaintance. She wondered, with\\r\\nlittle intermission what could be the reason of it; was sure there\\r\\nmust be some bad news, and thought over every kind of distress that\\r\\ncould have befallen him, with a fixed determination that he should not\\r\\nescape them all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure,\" said she.\\r\\n\"I could see it in his face. Poor man! I am afraid his circumstances\\r\\nmay be bad. The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two\\r\\nthousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved. I do\\r\\nthink he must have been sent for about money matters, for what else\\r\\ncan it be? I wonder whether it is so. I would give anything to know\\r\\nthe truth of it. Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I\\r\\ndare say it is, because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.\\r\\nMay be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely, for I\\r\\nhave a notion she is always rather sickly. I would lay any wager it is\\r\\nabout Miss Williams. It is not so very likely he should be distressed\\r\\nin his circumstances _now_, for he is a very prudent man, and to be\\r\\nsure must have cleared the estate by this time. I wonder what it can\\r\\nbe! May be his sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him over.\\r\\nHis setting off in such a hurry seems very like it. Well, I wish him\\r\\nout of all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the\\r\\nbargain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings. Her opinion varying with every\\r\\nfresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose.\\r\\nElinor, though she felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel\\r\\nBrandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly\\r\\naway, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling; for besides\\r\\nthat the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting\\r\\namazement or variety of speculation, her wonder was otherwise\\r\\ndisposed of. It was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her\\r\\nsister and Willoughby on the subject, which they must know to be\\r\\npeculiarly interesting to them all. As this silence continued, every\\r\\nday made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the\\r\\ndisposition of both. Why they should not openly acknowledge to her\\r\\nmother and herself, what their constant behaviour to each other\\r\\ndeclared to have taken place, Elinor could not imagine.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in\\r\\ntheir power; for though Willoughby was independent, there was no\\r\\nreason to believe him rich. His estate had been rated by Sir John at\\r\\nabout six or seven hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which\\r\\nthat income could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained\\r\\nof his poverty. But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by\\r\\nthem relative to their engagement, which in fact concealed nothing at\\r\\nall, she could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to\\r\\ntheir general opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered\\r\\nher mind of their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to\\r\\nprevent her making any inquiry of Marianne.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, than\\r\\nWilloughby\\'s behaviour. To Marianne it had all the distinguishing\\r\\ntenderness which a lover\\'s heart could give, and to the rest of the\\r\\nfamily it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother. The\\r\\ncottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many\\r\\nmore of his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general\\r\\nengagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him\\r\\nout in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest\\r\\nof the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his\\r\\nfavourite pointer at her feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left the\\r\\ncountry, his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of\\r\\nattachment to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood\\'s happening\\r\\nto mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring, he\\r\\nwarmly opposed every alteration of a place which affection had\\r\\nestablished as perfect with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What!\" he exclaimed, \"Improve this dear cottage! No. _That_ I will\\r\\nnever consent to. Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inch\\r\\nto its size, if my feelings are regarded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not be alarmed,\" said Miss Dashwood, \"nothing of the kind will be\\r\\ndone; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am heartily glad of it,\" he cried. \"May she always be poor, if she\\r\\ncan employ her riches no better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, Willoughby. But you may be assured that I would not\\r\\nsacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any one\\r\\nwhom I loved, for all the improvements in the world. Depend upon it\\r\\nthat whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in\\r\\nthe spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it\\r\\nin a manner so painful to you. But are you really so attached to this\\r\\nplace as to see no defect in it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am,\" said he. \"To me it is faultless. Nay, more, I consider it as\\r\\nthe only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were I\\r\\nrich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again\\r\\nin the exact plan of this cottage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes, I suppose,\" said\\r\\nElinor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" cried he in the same eager tone, \"with all and every thing\\r\\nbelonging to it--in no one convenience or inconvenience about it,\\r\\nshould the least variation be perceptible. Then, and then only, under\\r\\nsuch a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at\\r\\nBarton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I flatter myself,\" replied Elinor, \"that even under the disadvantage\\r\\nof better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your\\r\\nown house as faultless as you now do this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There certainly are circumstances,\" said Willoughby, \"which might\\r\\ngreatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim of\\r\\nmy affection, which no other can possibly share.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes were\\r\\nfixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well she\\r\\nunderstood him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How often did I wish,\" added he, \"when I was at Allenham this time\\r\\ntwelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited! I never passed within\\r\\nview of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no one\\r\\nshould live in it. How little did I then think that the very first\\r\\nnews I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country,\\r\\nwould be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate\\r\\nsatisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of\\r\\nprescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can account\\r\\nfor. Must it not have been so, Marianne?\" speaking to her in a lowered\\r\\nvoice. Then continuing his former tone, he said, \"And yet this house\\r\\nyou would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood? You would rob it of its simplicity by\\r\\nimaginary improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance\\r\\nfirst began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by\\r\\nus together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,\\r\\nand every body would be eager to pass through the room which has\\r\\nhitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort\\r\\nthan any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world\\r\\ncould possibly afford.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind should\\r\\nbe attempted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a good woman,\" he warmly replied. \"Your promise makes me\\r\\neasy. Extend it a little farther, and it will make me happy. Tell me\\r\\nthat not only your house will remain the same, but that I shall ever\\r\\nfind you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you will\\r\\nalways consider me with the kindness which has made everything\\r\\nbelonging to you so dear to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe promise was readily given, and Willoughby\\'s behaviour during the\\r\\nwhole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?\" said Mrs. Dashwood, when he was\\r\\nleaving them. \"I do not ask you to come in the morning, for we must\\r\\nwalk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe engaged to be with them by four o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood\\'s visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day, and\\r\\ntwo of her daughters went with her; but Marianne excused herself from\\r\\nbeing of the party, under some trifling pretext of employment; and her\\r\\nmother, who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the\\r\\nnight before of calling on her while they were absent, was perfectly\\r\\nsatisfied with her remaining at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn their return from the park they found Willoughby\\'s curricle and\\r\\nservant in waiting at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced\\r\\nthat her conjecture had been just. So far it was all as she had\\r\\nforeseen; but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had\\r\\ntaught her to expect. They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne\\r\\ncame hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with\\r\\nher handkerchief at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.\\r\\nSurprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had\\r\\njust quitted, where they found only Willoughby, who was leaning\\r\\nagainst the mantelpiece with his back towards them. He turned round\\r\\non their coming in, and his countenance showed that he strongly\\r\\npartook of the emotion which overpowered Marianne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is anything the matter with her?\" cried Mrs. Dashwood as she\\r\\nentered:--\"is she ill?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not,\" he replied, trying to look cheerful; and with a forced\\r\\nsmile presently added, \"It is I who may rather expect to be ill--for I\\r\\nam now suffering under a very heavy disappointment!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Disappointment?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you. Mrs. Smith has\\r\\nthis morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent\\r\\ncousin, by sending me on business to London. I have just received my\\r\\ndispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of\\r\\nexhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To London!--and are you going this morning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Almost this moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Apparently in violent affliction._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is very unfortunate. But Mrs. Smith must be obliged, and her\\r\\nbusiness will not detain you from us long I hope.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe coloured as he replied, \"You are very kind, but I have no idea of\\r\\nreturning into Devonshire immediately. My visits to Mrs. Smith are\\r\\nnever repeated within the twelvemonth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is Mrs. Smith your only friend? Is Allenham the only house in the\\r\\nneighbourhood to which you will be welcome? For shame, Willoughby, can\\r\\nyou wait for an invitation here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis colour increased; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only\\r\\nreplied, \"You are too good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise. Elinor felt equal\\r\\namazement. For a few moments every one was silent. Mrs. Dashwood first\\r\\nspoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage you\\r\\nwill always be welcome; for I will not press you to return here\\r\\nimmediately, because you only can judge how far _that_ might be\\r\\npleasing to Mrs. Smith; and on this head I shall be no more disposed\\r\\nto question your judgment than to doubt your inclination.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My engagements at present,\" replied Willoughby, confusedly, \"are of\\r\\nsuch a nature--that--I dare not flatter myself--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped. Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak, and\\r\\nanother pause succeeded. This was broken by Willoughby, who said with\\r\\na faint smile, \"It is folly to linger in this manner. I will not\\r\\ntorment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it\\r\\nis impossible for me now to enjoy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then hastily took leave of them all and left the room. They saw him\\r\\nstep into his carriage, and in a minute it was out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly quitted the\\r\\nparlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this\\r\\nsudden departure occasioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor\\'s uneasiness was at least equal to her mother\\'s. She thought of\\r\\nwhat had just passed with anxiety and distrust. Willoughby\\'s behaviour\\r\\nin taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation of\\r\\ncheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother\\'s\\r\\ninvitation--a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike\\r\\nhimself--greatly disturbed her. One moment she feared that no serious\\r\\ndesign had ever been formed on his side; and the next that some\\r\\nunfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister. The\\r\\ndistress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious\\r\\nquarrel could most reasonably account for, though when she considered\\r\\nwhat Marianne\\'s love for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her\\r\\nsister\\'s affliction was indubitable; and she thought with the\\r\\ntenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all\\r\\nprobability not merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and\\r\\nencouraging as a duty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn about half an hour her mother returned, and though her eyes were\\r\\nred, her countenance was not uncheerful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,\" said she,\\r\\nas she sat down to work, \"and with how heavy a heart does he travel?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is all very strange. So suddenly to be gone! It seems but the work\\r\\nof a moment. And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so\\r\\naffectionate? And now, after only ten minutes notice,--gone too\\r\\nwithout intending to return! Something more than what he owned to us\\r\\nmust have happened. He did not speak, he did not behave like himself.\\r\\n_You_ must have seen the difference as well as I. What can it be? Can\\r\\nthey have quarrelled? Why else should he have shown such unwillingness\\r\\nto accept your invitation here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could plainly see\\r\\n_that._ He had not the power of accepting it. I have thought it all\\r\\nover I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that at\\r\\nfirst seemed strange to me as well as to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you, indeed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way; but\\r\\nyou, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can--it will not satisfy\\r\\n_you_, I know; but you shall not talk _me_ out of my trust in it. I am\\r\\npersuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne,\\r\\ndisapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views for him,) and\\r\\non that account is eager to get him away; and that the business which\\r\\nshe sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss\\r\\nhim. This is what I believe to have happened. He is, moreover, aware\\r\\nthat she _does_ disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at\\r\\npresent confess to her his engagement with Marianne, and he feels\\r\\nhimself obliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her\\r\\nschemes, and absent himself from Devonshire for a while. You will tell\\r\\nme, I know, that this may or may _not_ have happened; but I will\\r\\nlisten to no cavil, unless you can point out any other method of\\r\\nunderstanding the affair as satisfactory at this. And now, Elinor,\\r\\nwhat have you to say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you would have told me, that it might or might not have\\r\\nhappened. Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings! You had\\r\\nrather take evil upon credit than good. You had rather look out for\\r\\nmisery for Marianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology\\r\\nfor the latter. You are resolved to think him blamable, because he\\r\\ntook leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has\\r\\nshown. And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits\\r\\ndepressed by recent disappointment? Are no probabilities to be\\r\\naccepted, merely because they are not certainties? Is nothing due to\\r\\nthe man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the\\r\\nworld to think ill of?--to the possibility of motives unanswerable in\\r\\nthemselves, though unavoidably secret for a while? And, after all,\\r\\nwhat is it you suspect him of?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can hardly tell myself. But suspicion of something unpleasant is\\r\\nthe inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed\\r\\nin him. There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged of\\r\\nthe allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to be\\r\\ncandid in my judgment of every body. Willoughby may undoubtedly have\\r\\nvery sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.\\r\\nBut it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at\\r\\nonce. Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at\\r\\nits being practiced by him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where\\r\\nthe deviation is necessary. But you really do admit the justice of\\r\\nwhat I have said in his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not entirely. It may be proper to conceal their engagement (if they\\r\\n_are_ engaged) from Mrs. Smith; and if that is the case, it must be\\r\\nhighly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at\\r\\npresent. But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse Willoughby and\\r\\nMarianne of concealment? This is strange indeed, when your eyes have\\r\\nbeen reproaching them every day for incautiousness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want no proof of their affection,\" said Elinor; \"but of their\\r\\nengagement I do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am perfectly satisfied of both.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, by either of\\r\\nthem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly. Has\\r\\nnot his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the last\\r\\nfortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his future\\r\\nwife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation?\\r\\nHave we not perfectly understood each other? Has not my consent been\\r\\ndaily asked by his looks, his manner, his attentive and affectionate\\r\\nrespect? My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement? How\\r\\ncould such a thought occur to you? How is it to be supposed that\\r\\nWilloughby, persuaded as he must be of your sister\\'s love, should\\r\\nleave her, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of\\r\\nhis affection,--that they should part without a mutual exchange of\\r\\nconfidence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I confess,\" replied Elinor, \"that every circumstance except _one_ is\\r\\nin favour of their engagement; but that _one_ is the total silence of\\r\\nboth on the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How strange this is! You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby,\\r\\nif, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt the\\r\\nnature of the terms on which they are together. Has he been acting a\\r\\npart in his behaviour to your sister all this time? Do you suppose him\\r\\nreally indifferent to her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I cannot think that. He must and does love her I am sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with such\\r\\nindifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered this\\r\\nmatter as certain. I have had my doubts, I confess; but they are\\r\\nfainter than they were, and they may soon be entirely done away. If we\\r\\nfind they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A mighty concession indeed! If you were to see them at the altar, you\\r\\nwould suppose they were going to be married. Ungracious girl! But I\\r\\nrequire no such proof. Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to\\r\\njustify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly\\r\\nopen and unreserved. You cannot doubt your sister\\'s wishes. It must be\\r\\nWilloughby therefore whom you suspect. But why? Is he not a man of\\r\\nhonour and feeling? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to\\r\\ncreate alarm? can he be deceitful?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not, I believe not,\" cried Elinor. \"I love Willoughby,\\r\\nsincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more\\r\\npainful to yourself than to me. It has been involuntary, and I will\\r\\nnot encourage it. I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his\\r\\nmanners this morning; he did not speak like himself, and did not\\r\\nreturn your kindness with any cordiality. But all this may be\\r\\nexplained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed. He\\r\\nhad just parted from my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest\\r\\naffliction; and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs.\\r\\nSmith, to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet aware\\r\\nthat by declining your invitation, by saying that he was going away\\r\\nfor some time, he should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part\\r\\nby our family, he might well be embarrassed and disturbed. In such a\\r\\ncase, a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more\\r\\nto his honour I think, as well as more consistent with his general\\r\\ncharacter;--but I will not raise objections against any one\\'s conduct\\r\\non so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself,\\r\\nor a deviation from what I may think right and consistent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You speak very properly. Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be\\r\\nsuspected. Though _we_ have not known him long, he is no stranger in\\r\\nthis part of the world; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?\\r\\nHad he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,\\r\\nit might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging\\r\\neverything to me at once: but this is not the case. It is an\\r\\nengagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriage\\r\\nmust be at a very uncertain distance; and even secrecy, as far as it\\r\\ncan be observed, may now be very advisable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret; and Elinor was then\\r\\nat liberty to think over the representations of her mother, to\\r\\nacknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the justice of all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time, when she entered the\\r\\nroom and took her place at the table without saying a word. Her eyes\\r\\nwere red and swollen; and it seemed as if her tears were even then\\r\\nrestrained with difficulty. She avoided the looks of them all, could\\r\\nneither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her mother\\'s silently\\r\\npressing her hand with tender compassion, her small degree of\\r\\nfortitude was quite overcome, she burst into tears and left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening. She\\r\\nwas without any power, because she was without any desire of command\\r\\nover herself. The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby\\r\\noverpowered her in an instant; and though her family were most\\r\\nanxiously attentive to her comfort, it was impossible for them, if\\r\\nthey spoke at all, to keep clear of every subject which her feelings\\r\\nconnected with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able\\r\\nto sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby. She\\r\\nwould have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next\\r\\nmorning, had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than\\r\\nwhen she lay down in it. But the feelings which made such composure a\\r\\ndisgrace, left her in no danger of incurring it. She was awake the\\r\\nwhole night, and she wept the greatest part of it. She got up with a\\r\\nheadache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;\\r\\ngiving pain every moment to her mother and sisters, and forbidding\\r\\nall attempt at consolation from either. Her sensibility was potent\\r\\nenough!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen breakfast was over she walked out by herself, and wandered about\\r\\nthe village of Allenham, indulging the recollection of past enjoyment\\r\\nand crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling. She played\\r\\nover every favourite song that she had been used to play to\\r\\nWilloughby, every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined,\\r\\nand sat at the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had\\r\\nwritten out for her, till her heart was so heavy that no farther\\r\\nsadness could be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every day\\r\\napplied. She spent whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing\\r\\nand crying; her voice often totally suspended by her tears. In books\\r\\ntoo, as well as in music, she courted the misery which a contrast\\r\\nbetween the past and present was certain of giving. She read nothing\\r\\nbut what they had been used to read together.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever; it\\r\\nsunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy; but these\\r\\nemployments, to which she daily recurred, her solitary walks and\\r\\nsilent meditations, still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as\\r\\nlively as ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected by Marianne.\\r\\nHer mother was surprised, and Elinor again became uneasy. But Mrs.\\r\\nDashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them, which at\\r\\nleast satisfied herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember, Elinor,\" said she, \"how very often Sir John fetches our\\r\\nletters himself from the post, and carries them to it. We have already\\r\\nagreed that secrecy may be necessary, and we must acknowledge that it\\r\\ncould not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through\\r\\nSir John\\'s hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried to find in it a\\r\\nmotive sufficient for their silence. But there was one method so\\r\\ndirect, so simple, and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real\\r\\nstate of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery, that she\\r\\ncould not help suggesting it to her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why do you not ask Marianne at once,\" said she, \"whether she is or\\r\\nshe is not engaged to Willoughby? From you, her mother, and so kind,\\r\\nso indulgent a mother, the question could not give offence. It would\\r\\nbe the natural result of your affection for her. She used to be all\\r\\nunreserve, and to you more especially.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not ask such a question for the world. Supposing it possible\\r\\nthat they are not engaged, what distress would not such an enquiry\\r\\ninflict! At any rate it would be most ungenerous. I should never\\r\\ndeserve her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession of\\r\\nwhat is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one. I know\\r\\nMarianne\\'s heart: I know that she dearly loves me, and that I shall\\r\\nnot be the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances\\r\\nmake the revealment of it eligible. I would not attempt to force the\\r\\nconfidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of duty\\r\\nwould prevent the denial which her wishes might direct.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor thought this generosity overstrained, considering her sister\\'s\\r\\nyouth, and urged the matter farther, but in vain; common sense, common\\r\\ncare, common prudence, were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood\\'s romantic\\r\\ndelicacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was several days before Willoughby\\'s name was mentioned before\\r\\nMarianne by any of her family; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed,\\r\\nwere not so nice; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;\\r\\nbut one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a volume of\\r\\nShakespeare, exclaimed--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have never finished _Hamlet_, Marianne; our dear Willoughby went\\r\\naway before we could get through it. We will put it by, that when he\\r\\ncomes again--; But it may be months, perhaps, before _that_ happens.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Months!\" cried Marianne, with strong surprise. \"No--nor many weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said; but it gave Elinor\\r\\npleasure, as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive of\\r\\nconfidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his intentions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning, about a week after his leaving the country, Marianne was\\r\\nprevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk, instead of\\r\\nwandering away by herself. Hitherto she had carefully avoided every\\r\\ncompanion in her rambles. If her sisters intended to walk on the\\r\\ndowns, she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of\\r\\nthe valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never\\r\\nbe found when the others set off. But at length she was secured by the\\r\\nexertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.\\r\\nThey walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,\\r\\nfor Marianne\\'s _mind_ could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied\\r\\nwith gaining one point, would not then attempt more. Beyond the\\r\\nentrance of the valley, where the country, though still rich, was less\\r\\nwild and more open, a long stretch of the road which they had\\r\\ntravelled on first coming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching\\r\\nthat point, they stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect\\r\\nwhich formed the distance of their view from the cottage, from a spot\\r\\nwhich they had never happened to reach in any of their walks before.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered an animated\\r\\none; it was a man on horseback riding towards them. In a few minutes\\r\\nthey could distinguish him to be a gentleman; and in a moment\\r\\nafterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is he; it is indeed--I know it is!\" and was hastening to meet him,\\r\\nwhen Elinor cried out--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken. It is not Willoughby. The\\r\\nperson is not tall enough for him, and has not his air.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has, he has,\" cried Marianne, \"I am sure he has. His air, his\\r\\ncoat, his horse. I knew how soon he would come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne\\r\\nfrom particularity, as she felt almost certain of its not being\\r\\nWilloughby, quickened her pace and kept up with her. They were soon\\r\\nwithin thirty yards of the gentleman. Marianne looked again; her heart\\r\\nsunk within her; and abruptly turning round, she was hurrying back,\\r\\nwhen the voices of both her sisters were raised to detain her; a\\r\\nthird, almost as well known as Willoughby\\'s, joined them in begging\\r\\nher to stop, and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome\\r\\nEdward Ferrars.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Begging her to stop._]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was the only person in the world who could at that moment be\\r\\nforgiven for not being Willoughby; the only one who could have gained\\r\\na smile from her; but she dispersed her tears to smile on _him_, and\\r\\nin her sister\\'s happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant, walked back with\\r\\nthem to Barton, whither he was purposely coming to visit them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was welcomed by them all with great cordiality, but especially by\\r\\nMarianne, who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him\\r\\nthan even Elinor herself. To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between\\r\\nEdward and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable\\r\\ncoldness which she had often observed at Norland in their mutual\\r\\nbehaviour. On Edward\\'s side, more particularly, there was a deficiency\\r\\nof all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion. He was\\r\\nconfused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked\\r\\nneither rapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him by\\r\\nquestions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection. Marianne\\r\\nsaw and listened with increasing surprise. She began almost to feel a\\r\\ndislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her,\\r\\nby carrying back her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a\\r\\ncontrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries\\r\\nof meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London. No,\\r\\nhe had been in Devonshire a fortnight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A fortnight!\" she repeated, surprised at his being so long in the\\r\\nsame county with Elinor without seeing her before.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked rather distressed as he added, that he had been staying with\\r\\nsome friends near Plymouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you been lately in Sussex?\" said Elinor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was at Norland about a month ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how does dear, dear Norland look?\" cried Marianne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear, dear Norland,\" said Elinor, \"probably looks much as it always\\r\\ndoes at this time of the year--the woods and walks thickly covered\\r\\nwith dead leaves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" cried Marianne, \"with what transporting sensation have I\\r\\nformerly seen them fall! How have I delighted, as I walked, to see\\r\\nthem driven in showers about me by the wind! What feelings have they,\\r\\nthe season, the air altogether inspired! Now there is no one to regard\\r\\nthem. They are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven\\r\\nas much as possible from the sight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is not every one,\" said Elinor, \"who has your passion for dead\\r\\nleaves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; my feelings are not often shared, not often understood. But\\r\\n_sometimes_ they are.\" As she said this, she sunk into a reverie for a\\r\\nfew moments; but rousing herself again, \"Now, Edward,\" said she,\\r\\ncalling his attention to the prospect, \"here is Barton valley. Look up\\r\\nto it, and be tranquil if you can. Look at those hills! Did you ever\\r\\nsee their equals? To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods and\\r\\nplantations. You may see the end of the house. And there, beneath that\\r\\nfarthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a beautiful country,\" he replied; \"but these bottoms must be\\r\\ndirty in winter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because,\" replied he, smiling, \"among the rest of the objects before\\r\\nme, I see a very dirty lane.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How strange!\" said Marianne to herself as she walked on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here? Are the Middletons pleasant\\r\\npeople?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, not all,\" answered Marianne; \"we could not be more unfortunately\\r\\nsituated.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marianne,\" cried her sister, \"how can you say so? How can you be so\\r\\nunjust? They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; and towards\\r\\nus have behaved in the friendliest manner. Have you forgot, Marianne,\\r\\nhow many pleasant days we have owed to them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Marianne, in a low voice, \"nor how many painful moments.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor took no notice of this; and directing her attention to their\\r\\nvisitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him, by\\r\\ntalking of their present residence, its conveniences, &c. extorting\\r\\nfrom him occasional questions and remarks. His coldness and reserve\\r\\nmortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry; but resolving to\\r\\nregulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present,\\r\\nshe avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated\\r\\nhim as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him; for his\\r\\ncoming to Barton was, in her opinion, of all things the most natural.\\r\\nHer joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder. He received\\r\\nthe kindest welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not\\r\\nstand against such a reception. They had begun to fail him before he\\r\\nentered the house, and they were quite overcome by the captivating\\r\\nmanners of Mrs. Dashwood. Indeed a man could not very well be in love\\r\\nwith either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her;\\r\\nand Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like\\r\\nhimself. His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his\\r\\ninterest in their welfare again became perceptible. He was not in\\r\\nspirits, however; he praised their house, admired its prospect, was\\r\\nattentive, and kind; but still he was not in spirits. The whole family\\r\\nperceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of\\r\\nliberality in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all\\r\\nselfish parents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are Mrs. Ferrars\\'s views for you at present, Edward?\" said she,\\r\\nwhen dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire; \"are you still\\r\\nto be a great orator in spite of yourself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents\\r\\nthan inclination for a public life!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how is your fame to be established? for famous you must be to\\r\\nsatisfy all your family; and with no inclination for expense, no\\r\\naffection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may find\\r\\nit a difficult matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall not attempt it. I have no wish to be distinguished; and have\\r\\nevery reason to hope I never shall. Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced\\r\\ninto genius and eloquence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have no ambition, I well know. Your wishes are all moderate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe. I wish as\\r\\nwell as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every body\\r\\nelse it must be in my own way. Greatness will not make me so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Strange that it would!\" cried Marianne. \"What have wealth or grandeur\\r\\nto do with happiness?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Grandeur has but little,\" said Elinor, \"but wealth has much to do\\r\\nwith it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Elinor, for shame!\" said Marianne, \"money can only give happiness\\r\\nwhere there is nothing else to give it. Beyond a competence, it can\\r\\nafford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, smiling, \"we may come to the same point.\\r\\n_Your_ competence and _my_ wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and\\r\\nwithout them, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every\\r\\nkind of external comfort must be wanting. Your ideas are only more\\r\\nnoble than mine. Come, what is your competence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than _that._\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor laughed. \"_Two_ thousand a year! _One_ is my wealth! I guessed\\r\\nhow it would end.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income,\" said\\r\\nMarianne. \"A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller. I am sure\\r\\nI am not extravagant in my demands. A proper establishment of\\r\\nservants, a carriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on\\r\\nless.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing so accurately their\\r\\nfuture expenses at Combe Magna.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hunters!\" repeated Edward; \"but why must you have hunters? Every body\\r\\ndoes not hunt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne coloured as she replied, \"But most people do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish,\" said Margaret, striking out a novel thought, \"that somebody\\r\\nwould give us all a large fortune a-piece!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh that they would!\" cried Marianne, her eyes sparkling with\\r\\nanimation, and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary\\r\\nhappiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose,\" said Elinor, \"in spite\\r\\nof the insufficiency of wealth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh dear!\" cried Margaret, \"how happy I should be! I wonder what I\\r\\nshould do with it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nDashwood, \"if my children were all to be rich without my help.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must begin your improvements on this house,\" observed Elinor,\\r\\n\"and your difficulties will soon vanish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London,\"\\r\\nsaid Edward, \"in such an event! What a happy day for booksellers,\\r\\nmusic-sellers, and print-shops! You, Miss Dashwood, would give a\\r\\ngeneral commission for every new print of merit to be sent you--and as\\r\\nfor Marianne, I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music\\r\\nenough in London to content her. And books!--Thomson, Cowper,\\r\\nScott--she would buy them all over and over again: she would buy up\\r\\nevery copy, I believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands;\\r\\nand she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old\\r\\ntwisted tree. Should not you, Marianne? Forgive me, if I am very\\r\\nsaucy. But I was willing to show you that I had not forgot our old\\r\\ndisputes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether it be melancholy\\r\\nor gay, I love to recall it--and you will never offend me by talking\\r\\nof former times. You are very right in supposing how my money would be\\r\\nspent; some of it, at least--my loose cash--would certainly be\\r\\nemployed in improving my collection of music and books.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the\\r\\nauthors or their heirs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person who\\r\\nwrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can ever\\r\\nbe in love more than once in their life--for your opinion on that\\r\\npoint is unchanged, I presume?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed. It is\\r\\nnot likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see,\" said Elinor, \"she is not\\r\\nat all altered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is only grown a little more grave than she was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, Edward,\" said Marianne, \"you need not reproach me. You are not\\r\\nvery gay yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should you think so!\" replied he, with a sigh. \"But gaiety never\\r\\nwas a part of _my_ character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor do I think it a part of Marianne\\'s,\" said Elinor; \"I should\\r\\nhardly call her a lively girl--she is very earnest, very eager in all\\r\\nshe does--sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation--but\\r\\nshe is not often really merry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe you are right,\" he replied, \"and yet I have always set her\\r\\ndown as a lively girl.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes,\" said\\r\\nElinor, \"in a total misapprehension of character in some point or\\r\\nother: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or\\r\\nstupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the\\r\\ndeception originated. Sometimes one is guided by what they say of\\r\\nthemselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them,\\r\\nwithout giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I thought it was right, Elinor,\" said Marianne, \"to be guided\\r\\nwholly by the opinion of other people. I thought our judgments were\\r\\ngiven us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours. This has\\r\\nalways been your doctrine, I am sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Marianne, never. My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of\\r\\nthe understanding. All I have ever attempted to influence has been the\\r\\nbehaviour. You must not confound my meaning. I am guilty, I confess,\\r\\nof having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with\\r\\ngreater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt their\\r\\nsentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of\\r\\ngeneral civility,\" said Edward to Elinor, \"Do you gain no ground?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite the contrary,\" replied Elinor, looking expressively at\\r\\nMarianne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My judgment,\" he returned, \"is all on your side of the question; but\\r\\nI am afraid my practice is much more on your sister\\'s. I never wish to\\r\\noffend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I\\r\\nam only kept back by my natural awkwardness. I have frequently thought\\r\\nthat I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company, I\\r\\nam so little at my ease among strangers of gentility!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers,\" said\\r\\nElinor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She knows her own worth too well for false shame,\" replied Edward.\\r\\n\"Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or\\r\\nother. If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy\\r\\nand graceful, I should not be shy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you would still be reserved,\" said Marianne, \"and that is worse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward started. \"Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not understand you,\" replied he, colouring. \"Reserved!--how, in\\r\\nwhat manner? What am I to tell you? What can you suppose?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor looked surprised at his emotion; but trying to laugh off the\\r\\nsubject, she said to him, \"Do not you know my sister well enough to\\r\\nunderstand what she means? Do not you know she calls every one\\r\\nreserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as\\r\\nrapturously as herself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward made no answer. His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him\\r\\nin their fullest extent--and he sat for some time silent and dull.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend. His\\r\\nvisit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction, while his own\\r\\nenjoyment in it appeared so imperfect. It was evident that he was\\r\\nunhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he still\\r\\ndistinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no\\r\\ndoubt of inspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his preference\\r\\nseemed very uncertain; and the reservedness of his manner towards her\\r\\ncontradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the\\r\\npreceding one.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room the next morning\\r\\nbefore the others were down; and Marianne, who was always eager to\\r\\npromote their happiness as far as she could, soon left them to\\r\\nthemselves. But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour\\r\\ndoor open, and, turning round, was astonished to see Edward himself\\r\\ncome out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am going into the village to see my horses,\" said he, \"as you are\\r\\nnot yet ready for breakfast; I shall be back again presently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding\\r\\ncountry; in his walk to the village, he had seen many parts of the\\r\\nvalley to advantage; and the village itself, in a much higher\\r\\nsituation than the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole,\\r\\nwhich had exceedingly pleased him. This was a subject which ensured\\r\\nMarianne\\'s attention, and she was beginning to describe her own\\r\\nadmiration of these scenes, and to question him more minutely on the\\r\\nobjects that had particularly struck him, when Edward interrupted her\\r\\nby saying, \"You must not enquire too far, Marianne: remember I have no\\r\\nknowledge in the picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance\\r\\nand want of taste if we come to particulars. I shall call hills steep,\\r\\nwhich ought to be bold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to\\r\\nbe irregular and rugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought\\r\\nonly to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.\\r\\nYou must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give. I\\r\\ncall it a very fine country,--the hills are steep, the woods seem full\\r\\nof fine timber, and the valley looks comfortable and snug,--with rich\\r\\nmeadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there. It\\r\\nexactly answers my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty\\r\\nwith utility--and I dare say it is a picturesque one too, because you\\r\\nadmire it; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and\\r\\npromontories, grey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.\\r\\nI know nothing of the picturesque.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid it is but too true,\" said Marianne; \"but why should you\\r\\nboast of it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suspect,\" said Elinor, \"that to avoid one kind of affectation,\\r\\nEdward here falls into another. Because he believes many people\\r\\npretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really\\r\\nfeel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greater\\r\\nindifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he\\r\\npossesses. He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very true,\" said Marianne, \"that admiration of landscape\\r\\nscenery is become a mere jargon. Every body pretends to feel and tries\\r\\nto describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what\\r\\npicturesque beauty was. I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes I\\r\\nhave kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language to\\r\\ndescribe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and\\r\\nmeaning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am convinced,\" said Edward, \"that you really feel all the delight\\r\\nin a fine prospect which you profess to feel. But, in return, your\\r\\nsister must allow me to feel no more than I profess. I like a fine\\r\\nprospect, but not on picturesque principles. I do not like crooked,\\r\\ntwisted, blasted trees. I admire them much more if they are tall,\\r\\nstraight, and flourishing. I do not like ruined, tattered cottages. I\\r\\nam not fond of nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms. I have more\\r\\npleasure in a snug farm-house than a watch-tower,--and a troop of\\r\\ntidy, happy villages please me better than the finest banditti in the\\r\\nworld.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne looked with amazement at Edward, with compassion at her\\r\\nsister. Elinor only laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject was continued no farther; and Marianne remained\\r\\nthoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly engaged her attention.\\r\\nShe was sitting by Edward, and in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood,\\r\\nhis hand passed so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a\\r\\nplait of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward,\" she cried. \"Is that\\r\\nFanny\\'s hair? I remember her promising to give you some. But I should\\r\\nhave thought her hair had been darker.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt; but when she saw\\r\\nhow much she had pained Edward, her own vexation at her want of\\r\\nthought could not be surpassed by his. He coloured very deeply, and\\r\\ngiving a momentary glance at Elinor, replied, \"Yes; it is my sister\\'s\\r\\nhair. The setting always casts a different shade on it, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise. That the hair\\r\\nwas her own, she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne;\\r\\nthe only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianne\\r\\nconsidered as a free gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must\\r\\nhave been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.\\r\\nShe was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, and\\r\\naffecting to take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking of\\r\\nsomething else, she internally resolved henceforward to catch every\\r\\nopportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all\\r\\ndoubt, that it was exactly the shade of her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward\\'s embarrassment lasted some time, and it ended in an absence of\\r\\nmind still more settled. He was particularly grave the whole morning.\\r\\nMarianne severely censured herself for what she had said; but her own\\r\\nforgiveness might have been more speedy, had she known how little\\r\\noffence it had given her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir John and Mrs.\\r\\nJennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the\\r\\ncottage, came to take a survey of the guest. With the assistance of\\r\\nhis mother-in-law, Sir John was not long in discovering that the name\\r\\nof Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine of\\r\\nraillery against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but the newness of\\r\\ntheir acquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being\\r\\nimmediately sprung. But, as it was, she only learned, from some very\\r\\nsignificant looks, how far their penetration, founded on Margaret\\'s\\r\\ninstructions, extended.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them to\\r\\ndine at the park the next day, or to drink tea with them that evening.\\r\\nOn the present occasion, for the better entertainment of their\\r\\nvisitor, towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute,\\r\\nhe wished to engage them for both.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You _must_ drink tea with us to night,\" said he, \"for we shall be\\r\\nquite alone; and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us, for we\\r\\nshall be a large party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Jennings enforced the necessity. \"And who knows but you may raise\\r\\na dance,\" said she. \"And that will tempt _you_, Miss Marianne.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A dance!\" cried Marianne. \"Impossible! Who is to dance?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Came to take a survey of the guest._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who? why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers to be sure.\\r\\nWhat! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that\\r\\nshall be nameless is gone!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish with all my soul,\" cried Sir John, \"that Willoughby were among\\r\\nus again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, and Marianne\\'s blushing, gave new suspicions to Edward. \"And who\\r\\nis Willoughby?\" said he, in a low voice, to Miss Dashwood, by whom he\\r\\nwas sitting.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe gave him a brief reply. Marianne\\'s countenance was more\\r\\ncommunicative. Edward saw enough to comprehend, not only the meaning\\r\\nof others, but such of Marianne\\'s expressions as had puzzled him\\r\\nbefore; and when their visitors left them, he went immediately round\\r\\nher, and said, in a whisper, \"I have been guessing. Shall I tell you\\r\\nmy guess?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall I tell you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne was surprised and confused, yet she could not help smiling at\\r\\nthe quiet archness of his manner, and after a moment\\'s silence, said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Edward! How can you?--But the time will come I hope--I am sure\\r\\nyou will like him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not doubt it,\" replied he, rather astonished at her earnestness\\r\\nand warmth; for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of\\r\\nher acquaintance in general, founded only on a something or a nothing\\r\\nbetween Mr. Willoughby and herself, he would not have ventured to\\r\\nmention it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly pressed by\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he were bent only on\\r\\nself-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment\\r\\namong his friends was at the height. His spirits, during the last two\\r\\nor three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improved--he\\r\\ngrew more and more partial to the house and environs--never spoke of\\r\\ngoing away without a sigh--declared his time to be wholly\\r\\ndisengaged--even doubted to what place he should go when he left\\r\\nthem--but still, go he must. Never had any week passed so quickly--he\\r\\ncould hardly believe it to be gone. He said so repeatedly; other\\r\\nthings he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the\\r\\nlie to his actions. He had no pleasure at Norland; he detested being\\r\\nin town; but either to Norland or London, he must go. He valued their\\r\\nkindness beyond any thing, and his greatest happiness was in being\\r\\nwith them. Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite of\\r\\ntheir wishes and his own, and without any restraint on his time.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his\\r\\nmother\\'s account; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose\\r\\ncharacter was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excuse\\r\\nfor every thing strange on the part of her son. Disappointed, however,\\r\\nand vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertain\\r\\nbehaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the whole to\\r\\nregard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous\\r\\nqualifications, which had been rather more painfully extorted from\\r\\nher, for Willoughby\\'s service, by her mother. His want of spirits, of\\r\\nopenness, and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want\\r\\nof independence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars\\'s\\r\\ndisposition and designs. The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of\\r\\nhis purpose in leaving them, originated in the same fettered\\r\\ninclination, the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his\\r\\nmother. The old well-established grievance of duty against will,\\r\\nparent against child, was the cause of all. She would have been glad\\r\\nto know when these difficulties were to cease, this opposition was to\\r\\nyield, when Mrs. Ferrars would be reformed, and her son be at liberty\\r\\nto be happy. But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for\\r\\ncomfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward\\'s affection, to the\\r\\nremembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from\\r\\nhim while at Barton, and above all to that flattering proof of it\\r\\nwhich he constantly wore round his finger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think, Edward,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were at breakfast the\\r\\nlast morning, \"you would be a happier man if you had any profession to\\r\\nengage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions. Some\\r\\ninconvenience to your friends, indeed, might result from it--you would\\r\\nnot be able to give them so much of your time. But (with a smile) you\\r\\nwould be materially benefited in one particular at least--you would\\r\\nknow where to go when you left them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do assure you,\" he replied, \"that I have long thought on this\\r\\npoint, as you think now. It has been, and is, and probably will always\\r\\nbe a heavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to\\r\\nengage me, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing\\r\\nlike independence. But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of\\r\\nmy friends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being. We never\\r\\ncould agree in our choice of a profession. I always preferred the\\r\\nchurch, as I still do. But that was not smart enough for my family.\\r\\nThey recommended the army. That was a great deal too smart for me. The\\r\\nlaw was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had chambers\\r\\nin the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first circles, and\\r\\ndrove about town in very knowing gigs. But I had no inclination for\\r\\nthe law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which my family\\r\\napproved. As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I was too\\r\\nold when the subject was first started to enter it; and, at length, as\\r\\nthere was no necessity for my having any profession at all, as I might\\r\\nbe as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one,\\r\\nidleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and\\r\\nhonourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly\\r\\nbent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do\\r\\nnothing. I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle\\r\\never since.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The consequence of which, I suppose, will be,\" said Mrs. Dashwood,\\r\\n\"since leisure has not promoted your own happiness, that your sons\\r\\nwill be brought up to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and\\r\\ntrades as Columella\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They will be brought up,\" said he, in a serious accent, \"to be as\\r\\nunlike myself as is possible. In feeling, in action, in condition, in\\r\\nevery thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits,\\r\\nEdward. You are in a melancholy humour, and fancy that any one unlike\\r\\nyourself must be happy. But remember that the pain of parting from\\r\\nfriends will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their\\r\\neducation or state. Know your own happiness. You want nothing but\\r\\npatience--or give it a more fascinating name, call it hope. Your\\r\\nmother will secure to you, in time, that independence you are so\\r\\nanxious for; it is her duty, and it will, it must ere long become her\\r\\nhappiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.\\r\\nHow much may not a few months do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think,\" replied Edward, \"that I may defy many months to produce any\\r\\ngood to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis desponding turn of mind, though it could not be communicated to\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all in the parting, which\\r\\nshortly took place, and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor\\'s\\r\\nfeelings especially, which required some trouble and time to subdue.\\r\\nBut as it was her determination to subdue it, and to prevent herself\\r\\nfrom appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his\\r\\ngoing away, she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by\\r\\nMarianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow, by\\r\\nseeking silence, solitude and idleness. Their means were as different\\r\\nas their objects, and equally suited to the advancement of each.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he was out of the\\r\\nhouse, busily employed herself the whole day, neither sought nor\\r\\navoided the mention of his name, appeared to interest herself almost\\r\\nas much as ever in the general concerns of the family, and if, by this\\r\\nconduct, she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented\\r\\nfrom unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters were spared much\\r\\nsolicitude on her account.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse of her own, appeared no\\r\\nmore meritorious to Marianne, than her own had seemed faulty to her.\\r\\nThe business of self-command she settled very easily;--with strong\\r\\naffections it was impossible, with calm ones it could have no merit.\\r\\nThat her sister\\'s affections _were_ calm, she dared not deny, though\\r\\nshe blushed to acknowledge it; and of the strength of her own, she\\r\\ngave a very striking proof, by still loving and respecting that\\r\\nsister, in spite of this mortifying conviction.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout shutting herself up from her family, or leaving the house in\\r\\ndetermined solitude to avoid them, or lying awake the whole night to\\r\\nindulge meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough\\r\\nto think of Edward, and of Edward\\'s behaviour, in every possible\\r\\nvariety which the different state of her spirits at different times\\r\\ncould produce,--with tenderness, pity, approbation, censure, and\\r\\ndoubt. There were moments in abundance, when, if not by the absence of\\r\\nher mother and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,\\r\\nconversation was forbidden among them, and every effect of solitude\\r\\nwas produced. Her mind was inevitably at liberty; her thoughts could\\r\\nnot be chained elsewhere; and the past and the future, on a subject so\\r\\ninteresting, must be before her, must force her attention, and engross\\r\\nher memory, her reflection, and her fancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her drawing-table, she was\\r\\nroused one morning, soon after Edward\\'s leaving them, by the arrival\\r\\nof company. She happened to be quite alone. The closing of the little\\r\\ngate, at the entrance of the green court in front of the house, drew\\r\\nher eyes to the window, and she saw a large party walking up to the\\r\\ndoor. Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,\\r\\nbut there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were quite\\r\\nunknown to her. She was sitting near the window, and as soon as Sir\\r\\nJohn perceived her, he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of\\r\\nknocking at the door, and stepping across the turf, obliged her to\\r\\nopen the casement to speak to him, though the space was so short\\r\\nbetween the door and the window, as to make it hardly possible to\\r\\nspeak at one without being heard at the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said he, \"we have brought you some strangers. How do you like\\r\\nthem?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hush! they will hear you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind if they do. It is only the Palmers. Charlotte is very\\r\\npretty, I can tell you. You may see her if you look this way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes, without\\r\\ntaking that liberty, she begged to be excused.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we are come? I see her\\r\\ninstrument is open.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is walking, I believe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not patience enough to\\r\\nwait till the door was opened before she told _her_ story. She came\\r\\nhallooing to the window, \"How do you do, my dear? How does Mrs.\\r\\nDashwood do? And where are your sisters? What! all alone! you will be\\r\\nglad of a little company to sit with you. I have brought my other son\\r\\nand daughter to see you. Only think of their coming so suddenly! I\\r\\nthought I heard a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,\\r\\nbut it never entered my head that it could be them. I thought of\\r\\nnothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again;\\r\\nso I said to Sir John, I do think I hear a carriage; perhaps it is\\r\\nColonel Brandon come back again--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle of her story, to\\r\\nreceive the rest of the party; Lady Middleton introduced the two\\r\\nstrangers; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same\\r\\ntime, and they all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs.\\r\\nJennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into\\r\\nthe parlour, attended by Sir John.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and totally\\r\\nunlike her in every respect. She was short and plump, had a very\\r\\npretty face, and the finest expression of good humour in it that could\\r\\npossibly be. Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister\\'s,\\r\\nbut they were much more prepossessing. She came in with a smile,\\r\\nsmiled all the time of her visit, except when she laughed, and smiled\\r\\nwhen she went away. Her husband was a grave looking young man of five\\r\\nor six and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his\\r\\nwife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased. He entered the\\r\\nroom with a look of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies,\\r\\nwithout speaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their\\r\\napartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read\\r\\nit as long as he stayed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed by nature with\\r\\na turn for being uniformly civil and happy, was hardly seated before\\r\\nher admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well! what a delightful room this is! I never saw anything so\\r\\ncharming! Only think, Mamma, how it is improved since I was here last!\\r\\nI always thought it such a sweet place, ma\\'am! (turning to Mrs.\\r\\nDashwood) but you have made it so charming! Only look, sister, how\\r\\ndelightful every thing is! How I should like such a house for myself!\\r\\nShould not you, Mr. Palmer?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise his eyes from\\r\\nthe newspaper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Palmer does not hear me,\" said she, laughing; \"he never does\\r\\nsometimes. It is so ridiculous!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had never been used to\\r\\nfind wit in the inattention of any one, and could not help looking\\r\\nwith surprise at them both.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud as she could, and\\r\\ncontinued her account of their surprise, the evening before, on seeing\\r\\ntheir friends, without ceasing till every thing was told. Mrs. Palmer\\r\\nlaughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment, and every\\r\\nbody agreed, two or three times over, that it had been quite an\\r\\nagreeable surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may believe how glad we all were to see them,\" added Mrs.\\r\\nJennings, leaning forward towards Elinor, and speaking in a low voice\\r\\nas if she meant to be heard by no one else, though they were seated on\\r\\ndifferent sides of the room; \"but, however, I can\\'t help wishing they\\r\\nhad not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it,\\r\\nfor they came all round by London upon account of some business, for\\r\\nyou know (nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter) it was\\r\\nwrong in her situation. I wanted her to stay at home and rest this\\r\\nmorning, but she would come with us; she longed so much to see you\\r\\nall!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her any harm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She expects to be confined in February,\" continued Mrs. Jennings.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation, and\\r\\ntherefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in\\r\\nthe paper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, none at all,\" he replied, and read on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here comes Marianne,\" cried Sir John. \"Now, Palmer, you shall see a\\r\\nmonstrous pretty girl.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe immediately went into the passage, opened the front door, and\\r\\nushered her in himself. Mrs. Jennings asked her, as soon as she\\r\\nappeared, if she had not been to Allenham; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so\\r\\nheartily at the question, as to show she understood it. Mr. Palmer\\r\\nlooked up on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes, and\\r\\nthen returned to his newspaper. Mrs. Palmer\\'s eye was now caught by\\r\\nthe drawings which hung round the room. She got up to examine them.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: \"_I declare they are quite charming_.\"]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! dear, how beautiful these are! Well! how delightful! Do but look,\\r\\nmama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming; I could look at\\r\\nthem for ever.\" And then sitting down again, she very soon forgot that\\r\\nthere were any such things in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer rose also, laid down\\r\\nthe newspaper, stretched himself and looked at them all around.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My love, have you been asleep?\" said his wife, laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made her no answer; and only observed, after again examining the\\r\\nroom, that it was very low pitched, and that the ceiling was crooked.\\r\\nHe then made his bow, and departed with the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at\\r\\nthe park. Mrs. Dashwood, who did not choose to dine with them oftener\\r\\nthan they dined at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account;\\r\\nher daughters might do as they pleased. But they had no curiosity to\\r\\nsee how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner, and no expectation of\\r\\npleasure from them in any other way. They attempted, therefore,\\r\\nlikewise, to excuse themselves; the weather was uncertain, and not\\r\\nlikely to be good. But Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriage\\r\\nshould be sent for them and they must come. Lady Middleton too, though\\r\\nshe did not press their mother, pressed them. Mrs. Jennings and Mrs.\\r\\nPalmer joined their entreaties, all seemed equally anxious to avoid a\\r\\nfamily party; and the young ladies were obliged to yield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should they ask us?\" said Marianne, as soon as they were gone.\\r\\n\"The rent of this cottage is said to be low; but we have it on very\\r\\nhard terms, if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying\\r\\neither with them, or with us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now,\" said Elinor, \"by\\r\\nthese frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them\\r\\na few weeks ago. The alteration is not in them, if their parties are\\r\\ngrown tedious and dull. We must look for the change elsewhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park the next\\r\\nday, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at the other, looking as\\r\\ngood humoured and merry as before. She took them all most\\r\\naffectionately by the hand, and expressed great delight in seeing them\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am so glad to see you!\" said she, seating herself between Elinor\\r\\nand Marianne, \"for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come,\\r\\nwhich would be a shocking thing, as we go away again tomorrow. We must\\r\\ngo, for the Westons come to us next week you know. It was quite a\\r\\nsudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the\\r\\ncarriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I\\r\\nwould go with him to Barton. He is so droll! He never tells me any\\r\\nthing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet\\r\\nagain in town very soon, I hope.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not go to town!\" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, \"I shall be quite\\r\\ndisappointed if you do not. I could get the nicest house in world for\\r\\nyou, next door to ours, in Hanover-square. You must come, indeed. I am\\r\\nsure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am\\r\\nconfined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey thanked her; but were obliged to resist all her entreaties.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my love,\" cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband, who just then entered\\r\\nthe room--\"you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to\\r\\ntown this winter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer love made no answer; and after slightly bowing to the ladies,\\r\\nbegan complaining of the weather.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How horrid all this is!\" said he. \"Such weather makes every thing and\\r\\nevery body disgusting. Dullness is as much produced within doors as\\r\\nwithout, by rain. It makes one detest all one\\'s acquaintance. What the\\r\\ndevil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his house?\\r\\nHow few people know what comfort is! Sir John is as stupid as the\\r\\nweather.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the company soon dropt in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid, Miss Marianne,\" said Sir John, \"you have not been able\\r\\nto take your usual walk to Allenham today.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne looked very grave and said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, don\\'t be so sly before us,\" said Mrs. Palmer; \"for we know all\\r\\nabout it, I assure you; and I admire your taste very much, for I think\\r\\nhe is extremely handsome. We do not live a great way from him in the\\r\\ncountry, you know. Not above ten miles, I dare say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Much nearer thirty,\" said her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, well! there is not much difference. I never was at his house; but\\r\\nthey say it is a sweet pretty place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life,\" said Mr. Palmer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne remained perfectly silent, though her countenance betrayed\\r\\nher interest in what was said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it very ugly?\" continued Mrs. Palmer--\"then it must be some other\\r\\nplace that is so pretty I suppose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were seated in the dining room, Sir John observed with\\r\\nregret that they were only eight all together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear,\" said he to his lady, \"it is very provoking that we should\\r\\nbe so few. Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me about it before,\\r\\nthat it could not be done? They dined with us last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You and I, Sir John,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"should not stand upon such\\r\\nceremony.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you would be very ill-bred,\" cried Mr. Palmer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My love you contradict every body,\" said his wife with her usual\\r\\nlaugh. \"Do you know that you are quite rude?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother\\r\\nill-bred.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, you may abuse me as you please,\" said the good-natured old lady,\\r\\n\"you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot give her back\\r\\nagain. So there I have the whip hand of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid\\r\\nof her; and exultingly said, she did not care how cross he was to her,\\r\\nas they must live together. It was impossible for any one to be more\\r\\nthoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy than Mrs.\\r\\nPalmer. The studied indifference, insolence, and discontent of her\\r\\nhusband gave her no pain; and when he scolded or abused her, she was\\r\\nhighly diverted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Palmer is so droll!\" said she, in a whisper, to Elinor. \"He is\\r\\nalways out of humour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him\\r\\ncredit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred\\r\\nas he wished to appear. His temper might perhaps be a little soured by\\r\\nfinding, like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable\\r\\nbias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly\\r\\nwoman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any\\r\\nsensible man to be lastingly hurt by it. It was rather a wish of\\r\\ndistinction, she believed, which produced his contemptuous treatment\\r\\nof every body, and his general abuse of every thing before him. It was\\r\\nthe desire of appearing superior to other people. The motive was too\\r\\ncommon to be wondered at; but the means, however they might succeed by\\r\\nestablishing his superiority in ill-breeding, were not likely to\\r\\nattach any one to him except his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood,\" said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards, \"I have\\r\\ngot such a favour to ask of you and your sister. Will you come and\\r\\nspend some time at Cleveland this Christmas? Now, pray do,--and come\\r\\nwhile the Westons are with us. You cannot think how happy I shall be!\\r\\nIt will be quite delightful!--My love,\" applying to her husband,\\r\\n\"don\\'t you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, with a sneer--\"I came into Devonshire with no\\r\\nother view.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There now,\"--said his lady, \"you see Mr. Palmer expects you; so you\\r\\ncannot refuse to come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But indeed you must and shall come. I am sure you will like it of all\\r\\nthings. The Westons will be with us, and it will be quite delightful.\\r\\nYou cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay\\r\\nnow, for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing\\r\\nagainst the election; and so many people came to dine with us that I\\r\\nnever saw before, it is quite charming! But, poor fellow! it is very\\r\\nfatiguing to him! for he is forced to make every body like him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the\\r\\nhardship of such an obligation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How charming it will be,\" said Charlotte, \"when he is in\\r\\nParliament!--won\\'t it? How I shall laugh! It will be so ridiculous to\\r\\nsee all his letters directed to him with an M.P. But do you know, he\\r\\nsays, he will never frank for me? He declares he won\\'t. Don\\'t you, Mr.\\r\\nPalmer?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Palmer took no notice of her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He cannot bear writing, you know,\" she continued; \"he says it is\\r\\nquite shocking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said he, \"I never said any thing so irrational. Don\\'t palm all\\r\\nyour abuses of languages upon me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There now; you see how droll he is. This is always the way with him!\\r\\nSometimes he won\\'t speak to me for half a day together, and then he\\r\\ncomes out with something so droll--all about any thing in the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room,\\r\\nby asking her whether she did not like Mr. Palmer excessively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" said Elinor; \"he seems very agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well--I am so glad you do. I thought you would, he is so pleasant;\\r\\nand Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can\\r\\ntell you, and you can\\'t think how disappointed he will be if you don\\'t\\r\\ncome to Cleveland. I can\\'t imagine why you should object to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor was again obliged to decline her invitation; and by changing\\r\\nthe subject, put a stop to her entreaties. She thought it probable\\r\\nthat as they lived in the same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to\\r\\ngive some more particular account of Willoughby\\'s general character,\\r\\nthan could be gathered from the Middletons\\' partial acquaintance with\\r\\nhim; and she was eager to gain from any one, such a confirmation of\\r\\nhis merits as might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne. She\\r\\nbegan by inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland,\\r\\nand whether they were intimately acquainted with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well,\" replied Mrs. Palmer;--\"Not\\r\\nthat I ever spoke to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in\\r\\ntown. Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while\\r\\nhe was at Allenham. Mama saw him here once before, but I was with my\\r\\nuncle at Weymouth. However, I dare say we should have seen a great\\r\\ndeal of him in Somersetshire, if it had not happened very unluckily\\r\\nthat we should never have been in the country together. He is very\\r\\nlittle at Combe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there, I do\\r\\nnot think Mr. Palmer would visit him, for he is in the opposition, you\\r\\nknow, and besides it is such a way off. I know why you inquire about\\r\\nhim, very well; your sister is to marry him. I am monstrous glad of\\r\\nit, for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" replied Elinor, \"you know much more of the matter than\\r\\nI do, if you have any reason to expect such a match.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t pretend to deny it, because you know it is what every body\\r\\ntalks of. I assure you I heard of it in my way through town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Mrs. Palmer!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my honour I did. I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in\\r\\nBond-street, just before we left town, and he told me of it directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You surprise me very much. Colonel Brandon tell you of it! Surely you\\r\\nmust be mistaken. To give such intelligence to a person who could not\\r\\nbe interested in it, even if it were true, is not what I should expect\\r\\nColonel Brandon to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I do assure you it was so, for all that, and I will tell you how\\r\\nit happened. When we met him, he turned back and walked with us; and\\r\\nso we began talking of my brother and sister, and one thing and\\r\\nanother, and I said to him, \\'So, Colonel, there is a new family come\\r\\nto Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word they are very\\r\\npretty, and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby\\r\\nof Combe Magna. Is it true, pray? for of course you must know, as you\\r\\nhave been in Devonshire so lately.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what did the Colonel say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh--he did not say much; but he looked as if he knew it to be true,\\r\\nso from that moment I set it down as certain. It will be quite\\r\\ndelightful, I declare! When is it to take place?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises, he did nothing but\\r\\nsay fine things of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am flattered by his commendation. He seems an excellent man; and I\\r\\nthink him uncommonly pleasing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So do I. He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he should\\r\\nbe so grave and so dull. Mamma says _he_ was in love with your sister\\r\\ntoo. I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardly\\r\\never falls in love with any body.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?\" said\\r\\nElinor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people are\\r\\nacquainted with him, because Combe Magna is so far off; but they all\\r\\nthink him extremely agreeable I assure you. Nobody is more liked than\\r\\nMr. Willoughby wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister. She\\r\\nis a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that he\\r\\nis much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome and\\r\\nagreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her. However, I don\\'t\\r\\nthink her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I think\\r\\nyou both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure,\\r\\nthough we could not get him to own it last night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Palmer\\'s information respecting Willoughby was not very material;\\r\\nbut any testimony in his favour, however small, was pleasing to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am so glad we are got acquainted at last,\" continued Charlotte.\\r\\n\"And now I hope we shall always be great friends. You can\\'t think how\\r\\nmuch I longed to see you! It is so delightful that you should live at\\r\\nthe cottage! Nothing can be like it, to be sure! And I am so glad your\\r\\nsister is going to be well married! I hope you will be a great deal at\\r\\nCombe Magna. It is a sweet place, by all accounts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon, have not you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married. He was a particular\\r\\nfriend of Sir John\\'s. I believe,\" she added in a low voice, \"he would\\r\\nhave been very glad to have had me, if he could. Sir John and Lady\\r\\nMiddleton wished it very much. But mama did not think the match good\\r\\nenough for me, otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the\\r\\nColonel, and we should have been married immediately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John\\'s proposal to your mother\\r\\nbefore it was made? Had he never owned his affection to yourself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he would have\\r\\nliked it of all things. He had not seen me then above twice, for it\\r\\nwas before I left school. However, I am much happier as I am. Mr.\\r\\nPalmer is the kind of man I like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and the two families\\r\\nat Barton were again left to entertain each other. But this did not\\r\\nlast long; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head,\\r\\nhad hardly done wondering at Charlotte\\'s being so happy without a\\r\\ncause, at Mr. Palmer\\'s acting so simply, with good abilities, and at\\r\\nthe strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and\\r\\nwife, before Sir John\\'s and Mrs. Jennings\\'s active zeal in the cause\\r\\nof society, procured her some other new acquaintance to see and\\r\\nobserve.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a morning\\'s excursion to Exeter, they had met with two young\\r\\nladies, whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be\\r\\nher relations, and this was enough for Sir John to invite them\\r\\ndirectly to the park, as soon as their present engagements at Exeter\\r\\nwere over. Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such\\r\\nan invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on\\r\\nthe return of Sir John, by hearing that she was very soon to receive a\\r\\nvisit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life, and of whose\\r\\nelegance--whose tolerable gentility even--she could have no proof; for\\r\\nthe assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for\\r\\nnothing at all. Their being her relations too made it so much the\\r\\nworse; and Mrs. Jennings\\'s attempts at consolation were therefore\\r\\nunfortunately founded, when she advised her daughter not to care about\\r\\ntheir being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put\\r\\nup with one another. As it was impossible, however, now to prevent\\r\\ntheir coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it, with\\r\\nall the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself with\\r\\nmerely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or\\r\\nsix times every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young ladies arrived: their appearance was by no means ungenteel\\r\\nor unfashionable. Their dress was very smart, their manners very\\r\\ncivil, they were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the\\r\\nfurniture, and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that\\r\\nLady Middleton\\'s good opinion was engaged in their favour before they\\r\\nhad been an hour at the Park. She declared them to be very agreeable\\r\\ngirls indeed, which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration. Sir\\r\\nJohn\\'s confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise,\\r\\nand he set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of\\r\\nthe Miss Steeles\\' arrival, and to assure them of their being the\\r\\nsweetest girls in the world. From such commendation as this, however,\\r\\nthere was not much to be learned; Elinor well knew that the sweetest\\r\\ngirls in the world were to be met with in every part of England, under\\r\\nevery possible variation of form, face, temper and understanding. Sir\\r\\nJohn wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at\\r\\nhis guests. Benevolent, philanthropic man! It was painful to him even\\r\\nto keep a third cousin to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do come now,\" said he--\"pray come--you must come--I declare you shall\\r\\ncome--You can\\'t think how you will like them. Lucy is monstrous\\r\\npretty, and so good humoured and agreeable! The children are all\\r\\nhanging about her already, as if she was an old acquaintance. And they\\r\\nboth long to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter that\\r\\nyou are the most beautiful creatures in the world; and I have told\\r\\nthem it is all very true, and a great deal more. You will be delighted\\r\\nwith them I am sure. They have brought the whole coach full of\\r\\nplaythings for the children. How can you be so cross as not to come?\\r\\nWhy they are your cousins, you know, after a fashion. _You_ are my\\r\\ncousins, and they are my wife\\'s, so you must be related.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Sir John could not prevail. He could only obtain a promise of\\r\\ntheir calling at the Park within a day or two, and then left them in\\r\\namazement at their indifference, to walk home and boast anew of their\\r\\nattractions to the Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of\\r\\nthe Miss Steeles to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to\\r\\nthese young ladies took place, they found in the appearance of the\\r\\neldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very plain and not a sensible\\r\\nface, nothing to admire; but in the other, who was not more than two\\r\\nor three and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her\\r\\nfeatures were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye, and a smartness\\r\\nof air, which though it did not give actual elegance or grace, gave\\r\\ndistinction to her person. Their manners were particularly civil, and\\r\\nElinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she saw\\r\\nwith what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves\\r\\nagreeable to Lady Middleton. With her children they were in continual\\r\\nraptures, extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring\\r\\ntheir whims; and such of their time as could be spared from the\\r\\nimportunate demands which this politeness made on it, was spent in\\r\\nadmiration of whatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be\\r\\ndoing any thing, or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in\\r\\nwhich her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing\\r\\ndelight. Fortunately for those who pay their court through such\\r\\nfoibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children,\\r\\nthe most rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous;\\r\\nher demands are exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing; and the\\r\\nexcessive affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her\\r\\noffspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest\\r\\nsurprise or distrust. She saw with maternal complacency all the\\r\\nimpertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins\\r\\nsubmitted. She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their\\r\\nears, their work-bags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen\\r\\naway, and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment. It\\r\\nsuggested no other surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit\\r\\nso composedly by, without claiming a share in what was passing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"John is in such spirits today!\" said she, on his taking Miss Steele\\'s\\r\\npocket handkerchief, and throwing it out of window--\"He is full of\\r\\nmonkey tricks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd soon afterwards, on the second boy\\'s violently pinching one of the\\r\\nsame lady\\'s fingers, she fondly observed, \"How playful William is!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Mischievous tricks._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And here is my sweet little Annamaria,\" she added, tenderly caressing\\r\\na little girl of three years old, who had not made a noise for the\\r\\nlast two minutes; \"And she is always so gentle and quiet--Never was\\r\\nthere such a quiet little thing!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut unfortunately in bestowing these embraces, a pin in her ladyship\\'s\\r\\nhead dress slightly scratching the child\\'s neck, produced from this\\r\\npattern of gentleness such violent screams, as could hardly be outdone\\r\\nby any creature professedly noisy. The mother\\'s consternation was\\r\\nexcessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, and\\r\\nevery thing was done by all three, in so critical an emergency, which\\r\\naffection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little\\r\\nsufferer. She was seated in her mother\\'s lap, covered with kisses, her\\r\\nwound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the Miss Steeles, who was\\r\\non her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by\\r\\nthe other. With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise to\\r\\ncease crying. She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her two\\r\\nbrothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings\\r\\nwere ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a\\r\\nscene of similar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had been\\r\\nsuccessfully applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly\\r\\nproposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission of\\r\\nscreams in the young lady on hearing it, gave them reason to hope that\\r\\nit would not be rejected. She was carried out of the room therefore in\\r\\nher mother\\'s arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the two boys\\r\\nchose to follow, though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay\\r\\nbehind, the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room\\r\\nhad not known for many hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor little creatures!\" said Miss Steele, as soon as they were gone.\\r\\n\"It might have been a very sad accident.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet I hardly know how,\" cried Marianne, \"unless it had been under\\r\\ntotally different circumstances. But this is the usual way of\\r\\nheightening alarm, where there is nothing to be alarmed at in\\r\\nreality.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!\" said Lucy Steele.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne was silent; it was impossible for her to say what she did not\\r\\nfeel, however trivial the occasion; and upon Elinor therefore the\\r\\nwhole task of telling lies when politeness required it, always fell.\\r\\nShe did her best when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton\\r\\nwith more warmth than she felt, though with far less than Miss Lucy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Sir John too,\" cried the elder sister, \"what a charming man he\\r\\nis!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere too, Miss Dashwood\\'s commendation, being only simple and just,\\r\\ncame in without any eclat. She merely observed that he was perfectly\\r\\ngood humoured and friendly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what a charming little family they have! I never saw such fine\\r\\nchildren in my life. I declare I quite doat upon them already, and\\r\\nindeed I am always distractedly fond of children.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should guess so,\" said Elinor, with a smile, \"from what I have\\r\\nwitnessed this morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a notion,\" said Lucy, \"you think the little Middletons rather\\r\\ntoo much indulged; perhaps they may be the outside of enough; but it\\r\\nis so natural in Lady Middleton; and for my part, I love to see\\r\\nchildren full of life and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame\\r\\nand quiet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I confess,\" replied Elinor, \"that while I am at Barton Park, I never\\r\\nthink of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA short pause succeeded this speech, which was first broken by Miss\\r\\nSteele, who seemed very much disposed for conversation, and who now\\r\\nsaid rather abruptly, \"And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?\\r\\nI suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some surprise at the familiarity of this question, or at least of\\r\\nthe manner in which it was spoken, Elinor replied that she was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?\" added Miss\\r\\nSteele.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have heard Sir John admire it excessively,\" said Lucy, who seemed\\r\\nto think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think every one _must_ admire it,\" replied Elinor, \"who ever saw\\r\\nthe place; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate\\r\\nits beauties as we do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And had you a great many smart beaux there? I suppose you have not so\\r\\nmany in this part of the world; for my part, I think they are a vast\\r\\naddition always.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why should you think,\" said Lucy, looking ashamed of her sister,\\r\\n\"that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as\\r\\nSussex?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, my dear, I\\'m sure I don\\'t pretend to say that there an\\'t. I\\'m\\r\\nsure there\\'s a vast many smart beaux in Exeter; but you know, how\\r\\ncould I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland; and I was\\r\\nonly afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they\\r\\nhad not so many as they used to have. But perhaps you young ladies may\\r\\nnot care about the beaux, and had as lief be without them as with\\r\\nthem. For my part, I think they are vastly agreeable, provided they\\r\\ndress smart and behave civil. But I can\\'t bear to see them dirty and\\r\\nnasty. Now there\\'s Mr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man,\\r\\nquite a beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you do but\\r\\nmeet him of a morning, he is not fit to be seen. I suppose your\\r\\nbrother was quite a beau, Miss Dashwood, before he married, as he was\\r\\nso rich?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" replied Elinor, \"I cannot tell you, for I do not\\r\\nperfectly comprehend the meaning of the word. But this I can say, that\\r\\nif he ever was a beau before he married, he is one still for there is\\r\\nnot the smallest alteration in him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men\\'s being beaux--they have\\r\\nsomething else to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord! Anne,\" cried her sister, \"you can talk of nothing but\\r\\nbeaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing\\r\\nelse.\" And then to turn the discourse, she began admiring the house\\r\\nand the furniture.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough. The vulgar freedom and\\r\\nfolly of the eldest left her no recommendation, and as Elinor was not\\r\\nblinded by the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest, to her want\\r\\nof real elegance and artlessness, she left the house without any wish\\r\\nof knowing them better.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot so the Miss Steeles. They came from Exeter, well provided with\\r\\nadmiration for the use of Sir John Middleton, his family, and all his\\r\\nrelations, and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair\\r\\ncousins, whom they declared to be the most beautiful, elegant,\\r\\naccomplished, and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom\\r\\nthey were particularly anxious to be better acquainted. And to be\\r\\nbetter acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found was their inevitable\\r\\nlot, for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles,\\r\\ntheir party would be too strong for opposition, and that kind of\\r\\nintimacy must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour or\\r\\ntwo together in the same room almost every day. Sir John could do no\\r\\nmore; but he did not know that any more was required: to be together\\r\\nwas, in his opinion, to be intimate, and while his continual schemes\\r\\nfor their meeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being\\r\\nestablished friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo do him justice, he did every thing in his power to promote their\\r\\nunreserve, by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew\\r\\nor supposed of his cousins\\' situations in the most delicate\\r\\nparticulars,--and Elinor had not seen them more than twice, before the\\r\\neldest of them wished her joy on her sister\\'s having been so lucky as\\r\\nto make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure,\" said\\r\\nshe, \"and I hear he is quite a beau, and prodigious handsome. And I\\r\\nhope you may have as good luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may\\r\\nhave a friend in the corner already.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in\\r\\nproclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward, than he had been\\r\\nwith respect to Marianne; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of\\r\\nthe two, as being somewhat newer and more conjectural; and since\\r\\nEdward\\'s visit, they had never dined together without his drinking to\\r\\nher best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and\\r\\nwinks, as to excite general attention. The letter F had been likewise\\r\\ninvariably brought forward, and found productive of such countless\\r\\njokes, that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had\\r\\nbeen long established with Elinor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Miss Steeles, as she expected, had now all the benefit of these\\r\\njokes, and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the\\r\\nname of the gentleman alluded to, which, though often impertinently\\r\\nexpressed, was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness\\r\\ninto the concerns of their family. But Sir John did not sport long\\r\\nwith the curiosity which he delighted to raise, for he had at least as\\r\\nmuch pleasure in telling the name, as Miss Steele had in hearing it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His name is Ferrars,\" said he, in a very audible whisper; \"but pray\\r\\ndo not tell it, for it\\'s a great secret.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Drinking to her best affections._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ferrars!\" repeated Miss Steele; \"Mr. Ferrars is the happy man, is he?\\r\\nWhat! your sister-in-law\\'s brother, Miss Dashwood? a very agreeable\\r\\nyoung man to be sure; I know him very well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you say so, Anne?\" cried Lucy, who generally made an\\r\\namendment to all her sister\\'s assertions. \"Though we have seen him\\r\\nonce or twice at my uncle\\'s, it is rather too much to pretend to know\\r\\nhim very well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor heard all this with attention and surprise. \"And who was this\\r\\nuncle? Where did he live? How came they acquainted?\" She wished very\\r\\nmuch to have the subject continued, though she did not choose to join\\r\\nin it herself; but nothing more of it was said, and for the first time\\r\\nin her life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either in curiosity\\r\\nafter petty information, or in a disposition to communicate it. The\\r\\nmanner in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward, increased her\\r\\ncuriosity; for it struck her as being rather ill-natured, and\\r\\nsuggested the suspicion of that lady\\'s knowing, or fancying herself to\\r\\nknow something to his disadvantage. But her curiosity was unavailing,\\r\\nfor no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars\\'s name by Miss Steele\\r\\nwhen alluded to, or even openly mentioned by Sir John.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne, who had never much toleration for any thing like\\r\\nimpertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts, or even difference of\\r\\ntaste from herself, was at this time particularly ill-disposed, from\\r\\nthe state of her spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles, or to\\r\\nencourage their advances; and to the invariable coldness of her\\r\\nbehaviour towards them, which checked every endeavour at intimacy on\\r\\ntheir side, Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself\\r\\nwhich soon became evident in the manners of both, but especially of\\r\\nLucy, who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation, or of\\r\\nstriving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank\\r\\ncommunication of her sentiments.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy was naturally clever; her remarks were often just and amusing;\\r\\nand as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her\\r\\nagreeable; but her powers had received no aid from education: she was\\r\\nignorant and illiterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement,\\r\\nher want of information in the most common particulars, could not be\\r\\nconcealed from Miss Dashwood, in spite of her constant endeavour to\\r\\nappear to advantage. Elinor saw, and pitied her for, the neglect of\\r\\nabilities which education might have rendered so respectable; but she\\r\\nsaw, with less tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy,\\r\\nof rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions, her\\r\\nassiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed; and she could have\\r\\nno lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined\\r\\ninsincerity with ignorance; whose want of instruction prevented their\\r\\nmeeting in conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct toward\\r\\nothers made every show of attention and deference towards herself\\r\\nperfectly valueless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will think my question an odd one, I dare say,\" said Lucy to her\\r\\none day, as they were walking together from the park to the\\r\\ncottage--\"but pray, are you personally acquainted with your\\r\\nsister-in-law\\'s mother, Mrs. Ferrars?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor _did_ think the question a very odd one, and her countenance\\r\\nexpressed it, as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\" replied Lucy; \"I wonder at that, for I thought you must have\\r\\nseen her at Norland sometimes. Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what\\r\\nsort of a woman she is?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward\\'s\\r\\nmother, and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent\\r\\ncuriosity; \"I know nothing of her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her in such\\r\\na way,\" said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke; \"but\\r\\nperhaps there may be reasons--I wish I might venture; but however I\\r\\nhope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be\\r\\nimpertinent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on for a few minutes in\\r\\nsilence. It was broken by Lucy, who renewed the subject again by\\r\\nsaying, with some hesitation--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious. I am sure I\\r\\nwould rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person\\r\\nwhose good opinion is so well worth having as yours. And I am sure I\\r\\nshould not have the smallest fear of trusting _you_; indeed, I should\\r\\nbe very glad of your advice how to manage in such and uncomfortable\\r\\nsituation as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble\\r\\n_you._ I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry I do _not_,\" said Elinor, in great astonishment, \"if it\\r\\ncould be of any use to _you_ to know my opinion of her. But really I\\r\\nnever understood that you were at all connected with that family, and\\r\\ntherefore I am a little surprised, I confess, at so serious an inquiry\\r\\ninto her character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it. But\\r\\nif I dared tell you all, you would not be so much surprised. Mrs.\\r\\nFerrars is certainly nothing to me at present--but the time _may_\\r\\ncome--how soon it will come must depend upon herself--when we may be\\r\\nvery intimately connected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked down as she said this, amiably bashful, with only one side\\r\\nglance at her companion to observe its effect on her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elinor, \"what do you mean? Are you acquainted\\r\\nwith Mr. Robert Ferrars? Can you be?\" And she did not feel much\\r\\ndelighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Lucy, \"not to Mr. _Robert_ Ferrars--I never saw him in\\r\\nmy life; but,\" fixing her eyes upon Elinor, \"to his eldest brother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment, that would have been as\\r\\npainful as it was strong, had not an immediate disbelief of the\\r\\nassertion attended it. She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement,\\r\\nunable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration; and\\r\\nthough her complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity, and felt\\r\\nin no danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may well be surprised,\" continued Lucy; \"for to be sure you could\\r\\nhave had no idea of it before; for I dare say he never dropped the\\r\\nsmallest hint of it to you or any of your family; because it was\\r\\nalways meant to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully\\r\\nkept so by me to this hour. Not a soul of all my relations know of it\\r\\nbut Anne, and I never should have mentioned it to you, if I had not\\r\\nfelt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy; and I\\r\\nreally thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs.\\r\\nFerrars must seem so odd, that it ought to be explained. And I do not\\r\\nthink Mr. Ferrars can be displeased, when he knows I have trusted\\r\\nyou, because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all\\r\\nyour family, and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods\\r\\nquite as his own sisters.\"--She paused.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Amiably bashful._]\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor for a few moments remained silent. Her astonishment at what she\\r\\nheard was at first too great for words; but at length forcing herself\\r\\nto speak, and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,\\r\\nwhich tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude--\"May I ask\\r\\nif your engagement is of long standing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have been engaged these four years.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Four years!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable to believe it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know,\" said she, \"that you were even acquainted till the\\r\\nother day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date. He was under my\\r\\nuncle\\'s care, you know, a considerable while.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your uncle!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; Mr. Pratt. Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I have,\" replied Elinor, with an exertion of spirits, which\\r\\nincreased with her increase of emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple, near\\r\\nPlymouth. It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister and me\\r\\nwas often staying with my uncle, and it was there our engagement was\\r\\nformed, though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he\\r\\nwas almost always with us afterwards. I was very unwilling to enter\\r\\ninto it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of\\r\\nhis mother; but I was too young, and loved him too well, to be so\\r\\nprudent as I ought to have been. Though you do not know him so well as\\r\\nme, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he\\r\\nis very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" answered Elinor, without knowing what she said; but after\\r\\na moment\\'s reflection, she added, with revived security of Edward\\'s\\r\\nhonour and love, and her companion\\'s falsehood--\"Engaged to Mr. Edward\\r\\nFerrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me,\\r\\nthat really--I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake\\r\\nof person or name. We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We can mean no other,\" cried Lucy, smiling. \"Mr. Edward Ferrars, the\\r\\neldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street, and brother of your\\r\\nsister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, is the person I mean; you must\\r\\nallow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on\\r\\nwho all my happiness depends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is strange,\" replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity, \"that I\\r\\nshould never have heard him even mention your name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; considering our situation, it was not strange. Our first care has\\r\\nbeen to keep the matter secret. You knew nothing of me, or my family,\\r\\nand, therefore, there could be no _occasion_ for ever mentioning my\\r\\nname to you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his sister\\'s\\r\\nsuspecting any thing, _that_ was reason enough for his not mentioning\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was silent. Elinor\\'s security sunk; but her self-command did not\\r\\nsink with it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Four years you have been engaged,\" said she with a firm voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait. Poor\\r\\nEdward! It puts him quite out of heart.\" Then taking a small miniature\\r\\nfrom her pocket, she added, \"To prevent the possibility of mistake, be\\r\\nso good as to look at this face. It does not do him justice, to be\\r\\nsure, but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was\\r\\ndrew for. I have had it above these three years.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor saw the\\r\\npainting, whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision, or\\r\\nher wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind,\\r\\nshe could have none of its being Edward\\'s face. She returned it almost\\r\\ninstantly, acknowledging the likeness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have never been able,\" continued Lucy, \"to give him my picture in\\r\\nreturn, which I am very much vexed at, for he has been always so\\r\\nanxious to get it! But I am determined to set for it the very first\\r\\nopportunity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite in the right,\" replied Elinor calmly. They then\\r\\nproceeded a few paces in silence. Lucy spoke first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I have no doubt in the world of your\\r\\nfaithfully keeping this secret, because you must know of what\\r\\nimportance it is to us, not to have it reach his mother; for she\\r\\nwould never approve of it, I dare say. I shall have no fortune, and I\\r\\nfancy she is an exceeding proud woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I certainly did not seek your confidence,\" said Elinor; \"but you do\\r\\nme no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on. Your\\r\\nsecret is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so\\r\\nunnecessary a communication. You must at least have felt that my being\\r\\nacquainted with it could not add to its safety.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy, hoping to discover\\r\\nsomething in her countenance; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest\\r\\npart of what she had been saying; but Lucy\\'s countenance suffered no\\r\\nchange.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you,\"\\r\\nsaid she, \"in telling you all this. I have not known you long to be\\r\\nsure, personally at least, but I have known you and all your family by\\r\\ndescription a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as\\r\\nif you was an old acquaintance. Besides in the present case, I really\\r\\nthought some explanation was due to you after my making such\\r\\nparticular inquiries about Edward\\'s mother; and I am so unfortunate,\\r\\nthat I have not a creature whose advice I can ask. Anne is the only\\r\\nperson that knows of it, and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she\\r\\ndoes me a great deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of\\r\\nher betraying me. She does not know how to hold her tongue, as you\\r\\nmust perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world\\r\\nt\\'other day, when Edward\\'s name was mentioned by Sir John, lest she\\r\\nshould out with it all. You can\\'t think how much I go through in my\\r\\nmind from it altogether. I only wonder that I am alive after what I\\r\\nhave suffered for Edward\\'s sake these last four years. Every thing in\\r\\nsuch suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him so seldom--we can hardly\\r\\nmeet above twice a-year. I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite\\r\\nbroke.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did not feel very\\r\\ncompassionate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sometimes,\" continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes, \"I think whether\\r\\nit would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely.\"\\r\\nAs she said this, she looked directly at her companion. \"But then at\\r\\nother times I have not resolution enough for it. I cannot bear the\\r\\nthoughts of making him so miserable, as I know the very mention of\\r\\nsuch a thing would do. And on my own account too--so dear as he is to\\r\\nme--I don\\'t think I could be equal to it. What would you advise me to\\r\\ndo in such a case, Miss Dashwood? What would you do yourself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pardon me,\" replied Elinor, startled by the question; \"but I can give\\r\\nyou no advice under such circumstances. Your own judgment must direct\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure,\" continued Lucy, after a few minutes silence on both\\r\\nsides, \"his mother must provide for him sometime or other; but poor\\r\\nEdward is so cast down by it! Did you not think him dreadful\\r\\nlow-spirited when he was at Barton? He was so miserable when he left\\r\\nus at Longstaple, to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him\\r\\nquite ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did he come from your uncle\\'s, then, when he visited us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us. Did you think he\\r\\ncame directly from town?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of every fresh\\r\\ncircumstance in favour of Lucy\\'s veracity; \"I remember he told us,\\r\\nthat he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth.\"\\r\\nShe remembered too, her own surprise at the time, at his mentioning\\r\\nnothing farther of those friends, at his total silence with respect\\r\\neven to their names.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?\" repeated Lucy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was\\r\\nthe matter; but it made him so melancholy, not being able to stay more\\r\\nthan a fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected. Poor\\r\\nfellow!--I am afraid it is just the same with him now; for he writes\\r\\nin wretched spirits. I heard from him just before I left Exeter;\"\\r\\ntaking a letter from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction\\r\\nto Elinor. \"You know his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is; but\\r\\nthat is not written so well as usual. He was tired, I dare say, for he\\r\\nhad just filled the sheet to me as full as possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor saw that it _was_ his hand, and she could doubt no longer. This\\r\\npicture, she had allowed herself to believe, might have been\\r\\naccidentally obtained; it might not have been Edward\\'s gift; but a\\r\\ncorrespondence between them by letter, could subsist only under a\\r\\npositive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else; for a few\\r\\nmoments, she was almost overcome--her heart sunk within her, and she\\r\\ncould hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; and she\\r\\nstruggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings, that\\r\\nher success was speedy, and for the time complete.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Writing to each other,\" said Lucy, returning the letter into her\\r\\npocket, \"is the only comfort we have in such long separations. Yes, I\\r\\nhave one other comfort in his picture, but poor Edward has not even\\r\\n_that._ If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy. I gave\\r\\nhim a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last,\\r\\nand that was some comfort to him, he said, but not equal to a picture.\\r\\nPerhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did,\" said Elinor, with a composure of voice, under which was\\r\\nconcealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt\\r\\nbefore. She was mortified, shocked, confounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage, and the\\r\\nconversation could be continued no farther. After sitting with them a\\r\\nfew minutes, the Miss Steeles returned to the Park, and Elinor was\\r\\nthen at liberty to think and be wretched.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever small Elinor\\'s general dependence on Lucy\\'s veracity might be,\\r\\nit was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the\\r\\npresent case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of\\r\\ninventing a falsehood of such a description. What Lucy had asserted to\\r\\nbe true, therefore, Elinor could not, dared not longer doubt;\\r\\nsupported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and\\r\\nproofs, and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes. Their\\r\\nopportunity of acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation\\r\\nfor the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward\\'s visit\\r\\nnear Plymouth, his melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at\\r\\nhis own prospects, his uncertain behaviour towards herself, the\\r\\nintimate knowledge of the Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family\\r\\nconnections, which had often surprised her, the picture, the letter,\\r\\nthe ring, formed altogether such a body of evidence, as overcame\\r\\nevery fear of condemning him unfairly, and established as a fact,\\r\\nwhich no partiality could set aside, his ill-treatment of herself. Her\\r\\nresentment of such behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe,\\r\\nfor a short time made her feel only for herself; but other ideas,\\r\\nother considerations, soon arose. Had Edward been intentionally\\r\\ndeceiving her? Had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel?\\r\\nWas his engagement to Lucy an engagement of the heart? No; whatever it\\r\\nmight once have been, she could not believe it such at present. His\\r\\naffection was all her own. She could not be deceived in that. Her\\r\\nmother, sisters, Fanny, all had been conscious of his regard for her\\r\\nat Norland; it was not an illusion of her own vanity. He certainly\\r\\nloved her. What a softener of the heart was this persuasion! How much\\r\\ncould it not tempt her to forgive! He had been blamable, highly\\r\\nblamable, in remaining at Norland after he first felt her influence\\r\\nover him to be more than it ought to be. In that, he could not be\\r\\ndefended; but if he had injured her, how much more had he injured\\r\\nhimself; if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless. His imprudence\\r\\nhad made her miserable for a while; but it seemed to have deprived\\r\\nhimself of all chance of ever being otherwise. She might in time\\r\\nregain tranquillity; but _he_, what had he to look forward to? Could\\r\\nhe ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he, were his\\r\\naffection for herself out of the question, with his integrity, his\\r\\ndelicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with a wife like\\r\\nher--illiterate, artful, and selfish?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to\\r\\nevery thing but her beauty and good nature; but the four succeeding\\r\\nyears--years, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to the\\r\\nunderstanding, must have opened his eyes to her defects of education,\\r\\nwhile the same period of time, spent on her side in inferior society\\r\\nand more frivolous pursuits, had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity\\r\\nwhich might once have given an interesting character to her beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself, his\\r\\ndifficulties from his mother had seemed great, how much greater were\\r\\nthey now likely to be, when the object of his engagement was\\r\\nundoubtedly inferior in connections, and probably inferior in fortune\\r\\nto herself. These difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated\\r\\nfrom Lucy, might not press very hard upon his patience; but melancholy\\r\\nwas the state of the person by whom the expectation of family\\r\\nopposition and unkindness, could be felt as a relief!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs these considerations occurred to her in painful succession, she\\r\\nwept for him, more than for herself. Supported by the conviction of\\r\\nhaving done nothing to merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by\\r\\nthe belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem, she\\r\\nthought she could even now, under the first smart of the heavy blow,\\r\\ncommand herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her\\r\\nmother and sisters. And so well was she able to answer her own\\r\\nexpectations, that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after\\r\\nshe had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes, no one\\r\\nwould have supposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor\\r\\nwas mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever\\r\\nfrom the object of her love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling\\r\\non the perfections of a man, of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly\\r\\npossessed, and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove\\r\\nnear their house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne, what had\\r\\nbeen entrusted in confidence to herself, though it obliged her to\\r\\nunceasing exertion, was no aggravation of Elinor\\'s distress. On the\\r\\ncontrary it was a relief to her, to be spared the communication of\\r\\nwhat would give such affliction to them, and to be saved likewise from\\r\\nhearing that condemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from\\r\\nthe excess of their partial affection for herself, and which was more\\r\\nthan she felt equal to support.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom their counsel, or their conversation, she knew she could receive\\r\\nno assistance, their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress,\\r\\nwhile her self-command would neither receive encouragement from their\\r\\nexample nor from their praise. She was stronger alone, and her own\\r\\ngood sense so well supported her, that her firmness was as unshaken,\\r\\nher appearance of cheerfulness as invariable, as with regrets so\\r\\npoignant and so fresh, it was possible for them to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the\\r\\nsubject, she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it; and this for\\r\\nmore reasons than one. She wanted to hear many particulars of their\\r\\nengagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what\\r\\nLucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her\\r\\ndeclaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted to\\r\\nconvince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the matter again, and her\\r\\ncalmness in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested in\\r\\nit than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntary\\r\\nagitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least\\r\\ndoubtful. That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very\\r\\nprobable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her\\r\\npraise, not merely from Lucy\\'s assertion, but from her venturing to\\r\\ntrust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so\\r\\nconfessedly and evidently important. And even Sir John\\'s joking\\r\\nintelligence must have had some weight. But indeed, while Elinor\\r\\nremained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by\\r\\nEdward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it\\r\\nnatural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her very\\r\\nconfidence was a proof. What other reason for the disclosure of the\\r\\naffair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of\\r\\nLucy\\'s superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in\\r\\nfuture? She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her\\r\\nrival\\'s intentions, and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as\\r\\nevery principle of honour and honesty directed, to combat her own\\r\\naffection for Edward and to see him as little as possible; she could\\r\\nnot deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her\\r\\nheart was unwounded. And as she could now have nothing more painful to\\r\\nhear on the subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust\\r\\nher own ability of going through a repetition of particulars with\\r\\ncomposure.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be\\r\\ncommanded, though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to take\\r\\nadvantage of any that occurred; for the weather was not often fine\\r\\nenough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they might most\\r\\neasily separate themselves from the others; and though they met at\\r\\nleast every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly\\r\\nat the former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of\\r\\nconversation. Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or\\r\\nLady Middleton\\'s head; and therefore very little leisure was ever\\r\\ngiven for a general chat, and none at all for particular discourse.\\r\\nThey met for the sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together,\\r\\nplaying at cards, or consequences, or any other game that was\\r\\nsufficiently noisy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne or two meetings of this kind had taken place, without affording\\r\\nElinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called at\\r\\nthe cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that they\\r\\nwould all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged to\\r\\nattend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be quite alone,\\r\\nexcept her mother and the two Miss Steeles. Elinor, who foresaw a\\r\\nfairer opening for the point she had in view, in such a party as this\\r\\nwas likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil\\r\\nand well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united\\r\\nthem together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the\\r\\ninvitation; Margaret, with her mother\\'s permission, was equally\\r\\ncompliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of their\\r\\nparties, was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her\\r\\nseclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from\\r\\nthe frightful solitude which had threatened her. The insipidity of the\\r\\nmeeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not one\\r\\nnovelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less\\r\\ninteresting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining\\r\\nparlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied\\r\\nthem, and while they remained there, she was too well convinced of the\\r\\nimpossibility of engaging Lucy\\'s attention to attempt it. They quitted\\r\\nit only with the removal of the tea-things. The card-table was then\\r\\nplaced, and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever\\r\\nentertained a hope of finding time for conversation at the park. They\\r\\nall rose up in preparation for a round game.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad,\" said Lady Middleton to Lucy, \"you are not going to finish\\r\\npoor little Annamaria\\'s basket this evening; for I am sure it must\\r\\nhurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight. And we will make the\\r\\ndear little love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow, and\\r\\nthen I hope she will not much mind it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied,\\r\\n\"Indeed you are very much mistaken, Lady Middleton; I am only waiting\\r\\nto know whether you can make your party without me, or I should have\\r\\nbeen at my filigree already. I would not disappoint the little angel\\r\\nfor all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now, I am\\r\\nresolved to finish the basket after supper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very good, I hope it won\\'t hurt your eyes:--will you ring the\\r\\nbell for some working candles? My poor little girl would be sadly\\r\\ndisappointed, I know, if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for\\r\\nthough I told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends upon\\r\\nhaving it done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with\\r\\nan alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could\\r\\ntaste no greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt\\r\\nchild.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others. No one made\\r\\nany objection but Marianne, who with her usual inattention to the\\r\\nforms of general civility, exclaimed, \"Your Ladyship will have the\\r\\ngoodness to excuse _me_--you know I detest cards. I shall go to the\\r\\npiano-forte; I have not touched it since it was tuned.\" And without\\r\\nfarther ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that _she_ had never\\r\\nmade so rude a speech.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know, ma\\'am,\"\\r\\nsaid Elinor, endeavouring to smooth away the offence; \"and I do not\\r\\nmuch wonder at it; for it is the very best toned piano-forte I ever\\r\\nheard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe remaining five were now to draw their cards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" continued Elinor, \"if I should happen to cut out, I may be\\r\\nof some use to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her papers for her; and\\r\\nthere is so much still to be done to the basket, that it must be\\r\\nimpossible I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening. I\\r\\nshould like the work exceedingly, if she would allow me a share in\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help,\" cried\\r\\nLucy, \"for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there\\r\\nwas; and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria\\r\\nafter all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! that would be terrible, indeed,\" said Miss Steele. \"Dear little\\r\\nsoul, how I do love her!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very kind,\" said Lady Middleton to Elinor; \"and as you\\r\\nreally like the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut\\r\\nin till another rubber, or will you take your chance now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals, and thus by\\r\\na little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to\\r\\npractise, gained her own end, and pleased Lady Middleton at the same\\r\\ntime. Lucy made room for her with ready attention, and the two fair\\r\\nrivals were thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the\\r\\nutmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work. The pianoforte at\\r\\nwhich Marianne, wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts, had\\r\\nby this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself,\\r\\nwas luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might\\r\\nsafely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting\\r\\nsubject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with,\\r\\nif I felt no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on\\r\\nits subject. I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward\\r\\nagain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" cried Lucy warmly, \"for breaking the ice; you have set my\\r\\nheart at ease by it; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended\\r\\nyou by what I told you that Monday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me,\" and Elinor spoke\\r\\nit with the truest sincerity, \"nothing could be farther from my\\r\\nintention than to give you such an idea. Could you have a motive for\\r\\nthe trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet I do assure you,\" replied Lucy, her little sharp eyes full of\\r\\nmeaning, \"there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your\\r\\nmanner that made me quite uncomfortable. I felt sure that you was\\r\\nangry with me; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for\\r\\nhaving took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs. But I am\\r\\nvery glad to find it was only my own fancy, and that you really do not\\r\\nblame me. If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my\\r\\nheart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of\\r\\nmy life, your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am\\r\\nsure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you,\\r\\nto acknowledge your situation to me, and be assured that you shall\\r\\nnever have reason to repent it. Your case is a very unfortunate one;\\r\\nyou seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties, and you will have\\r\\nneed of all your mutual affection to support you under them. Mr.\\r\\nFerrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would be madness to\\r\\nmarry upon that, though for my own part, I could give up every\\r\\nprospect of more without a sigh. I have been always used to a very\\r\\nsmall income, and could struggle with any poverty for him; but I love\\r\\nhim too well to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all\\r\\nthat his mother might give him if he married to please her. We must\\r\\nwait, it may be for many years. With almost every other man in the\\r\\nworld, it would be an alarming prospect; but Edward\\'s affection and\\r\\nconstancy nothing can deprive me of I know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That conviction must be every thing to you; and he is undoubtedly\\r\\nsupported by the same trust in your\\'s. If the strength of your\\r\\nreciprocal attachment had failed, as between many people, and under\\r\\nmany circumstances it naturally would during a four years\\' engagement,\\r\\nyour situation would have been pitiable, indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful in guarding her\\r\\ncountenance from every expression that could give her words a\\r\\nsuspicious tendency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Edward\\'s love for me,\" said Lucy, \"has been pretty well put to the\\r\\ntest, by our long, very long absence since we were first engaged, and\\r\\nit has stood the trial so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt\\r\\nit now. I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment\\'s alarm\\r\\non that account from the first.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy went on. \"I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature, and from\\r\\nour different situations in life, from his being so much more in the\\r\\nworld than me, and our continual separation, I was enough inclined for\\r\\nsuspicion, to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had\\r\\nbeen the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met, or\\r\\nany lowness of spirits that I could not account for, or if he had\\r\\ntalked more of one lady than another, or seemed in any respect less\\r\\nhappy at Longstaple than he used to be. I do not mean to say that I am\\r\\nparticularly observant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a case\\r\\nI am sure I could not be deceived.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All this,\" thought Elinor, \"is very pretty; but it can impose upon\\r\\nneither of us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what,\" said she after a short silence, \"are your views? or have\\r\\nyou none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars\\'s death, which is a\\r\\nmelancholy and shocking extremity?--Is her son determined to submit to\\r\\nthis, and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in\\r\\nwhich it may involve you, rather than run the risk of her displeasure\\r\\nfor a while by owning the truth?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we could be certain that it would be only for a while! But Mrs.\\r\\nFerrars is a very headstrong proud woman, and in her first fit of\\r\\nanger upon hearing it, would very likely secure every thing to Robert,\\r\\nand the idea of that, for Edward\\'s sake, frightens away all my\\r\\ninclination for hasty measures.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And for your own sake too, or you are carrying your disinterestedness\\r\\nbeyond reason.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy looked at Elinor again, and was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?\" asked Elinor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all--I never saw him; but I fancy he is very unlike his\\r\\nbrother--silly and a great coxcomb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great coxcomb!\" repeated Miss Steele, whose ear had caught those\\r\\nwords by a sudden pause in Marianne\\'s music. \"Oh, they are talking of\\r\\ntheir favourite beaux, I dare say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No sister,\" cried Lucy, \"you are mistaken there, our favourite beaux\\r\\nare _not_ great coxcombs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood\\'s is not,\" said Mrs. Jennings,\\r\\nlaughing heartily; \"for he is one of the modestest, prettiest behaved\\r\\nyoung men I ever saw; but as for Lucy, she is such a sly little\\r\\ncreature, there is no finding out who _she_ likes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: \"_I can answer for it,\" said Mrs. Jennings._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" cried Miss Steele, looking significantly round at them, \"I dare\\r\\nsay Lucy\\'s beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss\\r\\nDashwood\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor blushed in spite of herself. Lucy bit her lip, and looked\\r\\nangrily at her sister. A mutual silence took place for some time. Lucy\\r\\nfirst put an end to it by saying in a lower tone, though Marianne was\\r\\nthen giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent\\r\\nconcerto--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my\\r\\nhead, for bringing matters to bear; indeed I am bound to let you into\\r\\nthe secret, for you are a party concerned. I dare say you have seen\\r\\nenough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every\\r\\nother profession; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as\\r\\nhe can, and then through your interest, which I am sure you would be\\r\\nkind enough to use out of friendship for him, and I hope out of some\\r\\nregard to me, your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland\\r\\nliving; which I understand is a very good one, and the present\\r\\nincumbent not likely to live a great while. That would be enough for\\r\\nus to marry upon, and we might trust to time and chance for the rest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should always be happy,\" replied Elinor, \"to show any mark of my\\r\\nesteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars; but do you not perceive that my\\r\\ninterest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary? He is\\r\\nbrother to Mrs. John Dashwood--_that_ must be recommendation enough to\\r\\nher husband.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward\\'s going into\\r\\norders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were again silent for many minutes. At length Lucy exclaimed with\\r\\na deep sigh--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at\\r\\nonce by dissolving the engagement. We seem so beset with difficulties\\r\\non every side, that though it would make us miserable for a time, we\\r\\nshould be happier perhaps in the end. But you will not give me your\\r\\nadvice, Miss Dashwood?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed very agitated\\r\\nfeelings, \"on such a subject I certainly will not. You know very well\\r\\nthat my opinion would have no weight with you, unless it were on the\\r\\nside of your wishes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed you wrong me,\" replied Lucy, with great solemnity; \"I know\\r\\nnobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours; and I do\\r\\nreally believe, that if you was to say to me, \\'I advise you by all\\r\\nmeans to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars, it will be\\r\\nmore for the happiness of both of you,\\' I should resolve upon doing it\\r\\nimmediately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward\\'s future wife, and\\r\\nreplied, \"This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving\\r\\nany opinion on the subject had I formed one. It raises my influence\\r\\nmuch too high; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached\\r\\nis too much for an indifferent person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tis because you are an indifferent person,\" said Lucy, with some\\r\\npique, and laying a particular stress on those words, \"that your\\r\\njudgment might justly have such weight with me. If you could be\\r\\nsupposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings, your\\r\\nopinion would not be worth having.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this, lest they might\\r\\nprovoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve;\\r\\nand was even partly determined never to mention the subject again.\\r\\nAnother pause therefore of many minutes\\' duration, succeeded this\\r\\nspeech, and Lucy was still the first to end it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?\" said she with all\\r\\nher accustomary complacency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry for that,\" returned the other, while her eyes brightened\\r\\nat the information, \"it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you\\r\\nthere! But I dare say you will go for all that. To be sure, your\\r\\nbrother and sister will ask you to come to them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How unlucky that is! I had quite depended upon meeting you there.\\r\\nAnne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who\\r\\nhave been wanting us to visit them these several years! But I only go\\r\\nfor the sake of seeing Edward. He will be there in February, otherwise\\r\\nLondon would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of the\\r\\nfirst rubber, and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was\\r\\ntherefore at an end, to which both of them submitted without any\\r\\nreluctance, for nothing had been said on either side to make them\\r\\ndislike each other less than they had done before; and Elinor sat down\\r\\nto the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not\\r\\nonly without affection for the person who was to be his wife; but that\\r\\nhe had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage, which\\r\\nsincere affection on _her_ side would have given, for self-interest\\r\\nalone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement, of which\\r\\nshe seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this time the subject was never revived by Elinor, and when\\r\\nentered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing\\r\\nit, and was particularly careful to inform her confidante, of her\\r\\nhappiness whenever she received a letter from Edward, it was treated\\r\\nby the former with calmness and caution, and dismissed as soon as\\r\\ncivility would allow; for she felt such conversations to be an\\r\\nindulgence which Lucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to\\r\\nherself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was lengthened far beyond\\r\\nwhat the first invitation implied. Their favour increased; they could\\r\\nnot be spared; Sir John would not hear of their going; and in spite of\\r\\ntheir numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter, in spite of\\r\\nthe absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately, which\\r\\nwas in full force at the end of every week, they were prevailed on to\\r\\nstay nearly two months at the park, and to assist in the due\\r\\ncelebration of that festival which requires a more than ordinary share\\r\\nof private balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of\\r\\nthe year at the houses of her children and friends, she was not\\r\\nwithout a settled habitation of her own. Since the death of her\\r\\nhusband, who had traded with success in a less elegant part of the\\r\\ntown, she had resided every winter in a house in one of the streets\\r\\nnear Portman Square. Towards this home, she began on the approach of\\r\\nJanuary to turn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly, and\\r\\nvery unexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses Dashwood to\\r\\naccompany her. Elinor, without observing the varying complexion of her\\r\\nsister, and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan,\\r\\nimmediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she\\r\\nbelieved herself to be speaking their united inclinations. The reason\\r\\nalleged was their determined resolution of not leaving their mother at\\r\\nthat time of the year. Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some\\r\\nsurprise, and repeated her invitation immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you very well, and I _do_\\r\\nbeg you will favour me with your company, for I\\'ve quite set my heart\\r\\nupon it. Don\\'t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me, for I\\r\\nshan\\'t put myself at all out of my way for you. It will only be\\r\\nsending Betty by the coach, and I hope I can afford _that._ We three\\r\\nshall be able to go very well in my chaise; and when we are in town,\\r\\nif you do not like to go wherever I do, well and good, you may always\\r\\ngo with one of my daughters. I am sure your mother will not object to\\r\\nit; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my\\r\\nhands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of\\r\\nyou; and if I don\\'t get one of you at least well married before I have\\r\\ndone with you, it shall not be my fault. I shall speak a good word for\\r\\nyou to all the young men, you may depend upon it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a notion,\" said Sir John, \"that Miss Marianne would not object\\r\\nto such a scheme, if her elder sister would come into it. It is very\\r\\nhard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure, because Miss\\r\\nDashwood does not wish it. So I would advise you two, to set off for\\r\\ntown, when you are tired of Barton, without saying a word to Miss\\r\\nDashwood about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay,\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of\\r\\nMiss Marianne\\'s company, whether Miss Dashwood will go or not, only\\r\\nthe more the merrier say I, and I thought it would be more comfortable\\r\\nfor them to be together; because, if they got tired of me, they might\\r\\ntalk to one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back. But one\\r\\nor the other, if not both of them, I must have. Lord bless me! how do\\r\\nyou think I can live poking by myself, I who have been always used\\r\\ntill this winter to have Charlotte with me. Come, Miss Marianne, let\\r\\nus strike hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change her\\r\\nmind by and bye, why so much the better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thank you, ma\\'am, sincerely thank you,\" said Marianne, with warmth:\\r\\n\"your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever, and it would give\\r\\nme such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of,\\r\\nto be able to accept it. But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,--I\\r\\nfeel the justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be made\\r\\nless happy, less comfortable by our absence--Oh! no, nothing should\\r\\ntempt me to leave her. It should not, must not be a struggle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare\\r\\nthem perfectly well; and Elinor, who now understood her sister, and\\r\\nsaw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by\\r\\nher eagerness to be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct\\r\\nopposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her mother\\'s\\r\\ndecision, from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any\\r\\nsupport in her endeavour to prevent a visit, which she could not\\r\\napprove of for Marianne, and which on her own account she had\\r\\nparticular reasons to avoid. Whatever Marianne was desirous of, her\\r\\nmother would be eager to promote--she could not expect to influence\\r\\nthe latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which\\r\\nshe had never been able to inspire her with distrust; and she dared\\r\\nnot explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to London.\\r\\nThat Marianne, fastidious as she was, thoroughly acquainted with Mrs.\\r\\nJennings\\' manners, and invariably disgusted by them, should overlook\\r\\nevery inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever must be\\r\\nmost wounding to her irritable feelings, in her pursuit of one object,\\r\\nwas such a proof, so strong, so full, of the importance of that object\\r\\nto her, as Elinor, in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared\\r\\nto witness.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood, persuaded that\\r\\nsuch an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her\\r\\ndaughters, and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to\\r\\nherself, how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear of\\r\\ntheir declining the offer upon _her_ account; insisted on their both\\r\\naccepting it directly; and then began to foresee, with her usual\\r\\ncheerfulness, a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all,\\r\\nfrom this separation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am delighted with the plan,\" she cried, \"it is exactly what I could\\r\\nwish. Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves.\\r\\nWhen you and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly and\\r\\nhappily together with our books and our music! You will find Margaret\\r\\nso improved when you come back again! I have a little plan of\\r\\nalteration for your bedrooms too, which may now be performed without\\r\\nany inconvenience to any one. It is very right that you _should_ go to\\r\\ntown; I would have every young woman of your condition in life\\r\\nacquainted with the manners and amusements of London. You will be\\r\\nunder the care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness to\\r\\nyou I can have no doubt. And in all probability you will see your\\r\\nbrother, and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife,\\r\\nwhen I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so wholly\\r\\nestranged from each other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness,\" said Elinor, \"you\\r\\nhave been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which\\r\\noccurred to you, there is still one objection which, in my opinion,\\r\\ncannot be so easily removed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne\\'s countenance sunk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, \"is my dear prudent Elinor going to\\r\\nsuggest? What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward? Do let\\r\\nme hear a word about the expense of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My objection is this; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\r\\nheart, she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure, or\\r\\nwhose protection will give us consequence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very true,\" replied her mother, \"but of her society,\\r\\nseparately from that of other people, you will scarcely have any thing\\r\\nat all, and you will almost always appear in public with Lady\\r\\nMiddleton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings,\" said\\r\\nMarianne, \"at least it need not prevent _my_ accepting her invitation.\\r\\nI have no such scruples, and I am sure I could put up with every\\r\\nunpleasantness of that kind with very little effort.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards\\r\\nthe manners of a person, to whom she had often had difficulty in\\r\\npersuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness; and resolved\\r\\nwithin herself, that if her sister persisted in going, she would go\\r\\nlikewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left\\r\\nto the sole guidance of her own judgment, or that Mrs. Jennings should\\r\\nbe abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her\\r\\ndomestic hours. To this determination she was the more easily\\r\\nreconciled, by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy\\'s account,\\r\\nwas not to be in town before February; and that their visit, without\\r\\nany unreasonable abridgement, might be previously finished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will have you _both_ go,\" said Mrs. Dashwood; \"these objections are\\r\\nnonsensical. You will have much pleasure in being in London, and\\r\\nespecially in being together; and if Elinor would ever condescend to\\r\\nanticipate enjoyment, she would foresee it there from a variety of\\r\\nsources; she would, perhaps, expect some from improving her\\r\\nacquaintance with her sister-in-law\\'s family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her\\r\\nmother\\'s dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself, that the\\r\\nshock might be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now on\\r\\nthis attack, though almost hopeless of success, she forced herself to\\r\\nbegin her design by saying, as calmly as she could, \"I like Edward\\r\\nFerrars very much, and shall always be glad to see him; but as to the\\r\\nrest of the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference to me,\\r\\nwhether I am ever known to them or not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing. Marianne lifted up her eyes in\\r\\nastonishment, and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held\\r\\nher tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter very little farther discourse, it was finally settled that the\\r\\ninvitation should be fully accepted. Mrs. Jennings received the\\r\\ninformation with a great deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness\\r\\nand care; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her. Sir John was\\r\\ndelighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of\\r\\nbeing alone, the acquisition of two, to the number of inhabitants in\\r\\nLondon, was something. Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being\\r\\ndelighted, which was putting herself rather out of her way; and as\\r\\nfor the Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had never been so happy in\\r\\ntheir lives as this intelligence made them.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with\\r\\nless reluctance than she had expected to feel. With regard to herself,\\r\\nit was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not, and\\r\\nwhen she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan, and her\\r\\nsister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner, restored to all\\r\\nher usual animation, and elevated to more than her usual gaiety, she\\r\\ncould not be dissatisfied with the cause, and would hardly allow\\r\\nherself to distrust the consequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne\\'s joy was almost a degree beyond happiness, so great was the\\r\\nperturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone. Her\\r\\nunwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness;\\r\\nand at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive.\\r\\nHer mother\\'s affliction was hardly less, and Elinor was the only one\\r\\nof the three, who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short\\r\\nof eternal.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir departure took place in the first week in January. The\\r\\nMiddletons were to follow in about a week. The Miss Steeles kept their\\r\\nstation at the park, and were to quit it only with the rest of the\\r\\nfamily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, and\\r\\nbeginning a journey to London under her protection, and as her guest,\\r\\nwithout wondering at her own situation, so short had their\\r\\nacquaintance with that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age\\r\\nand disposition, and so many had been her objections against such a\\r\\nmeasure only a few days before! But these objections had all, with\\r\\nthat happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally\\r\\nshared, been overcome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of every\\r\\noccasional doubt of Willoughby\\'s constancy, could not witness the\\r\\nrapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and\\r\\nbeamed in the eyes of Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own\\r\\nprospect, how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison, and\\r\\nhow gladly she would engage in the solicitude of Marianne\\'s situation\\r\\nto have the same animating object in view, the same possibility of\\r\\nhope. A short, a very short time however must now decide what\\r\\nWilloughby\\'s intentions were; in all probability he was already in\\r\\ntown. Marianne\\'s eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on\\r\\nfinding him there; and Elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every\\r\\nnew light as to his character which her own observation or the\\r\\nintelligence of others could give her, but likewise upon watching his\\r\\nbehaviour to her sister with such zealous attention, as to ascertain\\r\\nwhat he was and what he meant, before many meetings had taken place.\\r\\nShould the result of her observations be unfavourable, she was\\r\\ndetermined at all events to open the eyes of her sister; should it be\\r\\notherwise, her exertions would be of a different nature--she must then\\r\\nlearn to avoid every selfish comparison, and banish every regret which\\r\\nmight lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were three days on their journey, and Marianne\\'s behaviour as\\r\\nthey travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and\\r\\ncompanionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be. She sat in\\r\\nsilence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely\\r\\never voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque\\r\\nbeauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight\\r\\nexclusively addressed to her sister. To atone for this conduct\\r\\ntherefore, Elinor took immediate possession of the post of civility\\r\\nwhich she had assigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to\\r\\nMrs. Jennings, talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her\\r\\nwhenever she could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both\\r\\nwith all possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their\\r\\nease and enjoyment, and only disturbed that she could not make them\\r\\nchoose their own dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their\\r\\npreferring salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets. They\\r\\nreached town by three o\\'clock the third day, glad to be released,\\r\\nafter such a journey, from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to\\r\\nenjoy all the luxury of a good fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and the young\\r\\nladies were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable\\r\\napartment. It had formerly been Charlotte\\'s, and over the mantelpiece\\r\\nstill hung a landscape in coloured silks of her performance, in proof\\r\\nof her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some\\r\\neffect.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their\\r\\narrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her\\r\\nmother, and sat down for that purpose. In a few moments Marianne did\\r\\nthe same. \"I am writing home, Marianne,\" said Elinor; \"had not you\\r\\nbetter defer your letter for a day or two?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am _not_ going to write to my mother,\" replied Marianne, hastily,\\r\\nand as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry. Elinor said no more;\\r\\nit immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby;\\r\\nand the conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, however\\r\\nmysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must be\\r\\nengaged. This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her\\r\\npleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.\\r\\nMarianne\\'s was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be\\r\\nno more than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with\\r\\neager rapidity. Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the\\r\\ndirection; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the\\r\\nbell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter\\r\\nconveyed for her to the two-penny post. This decided the matter at\\r\\nonce.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer spirits still continued very high; but there was a flutter in them\\r\\nwhich prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister, and this\\r\\nagitation increased as the evening drew on. She could scarcely eat any\\r\\ndinner, and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room, seemed\\r\\nanxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being\\r\\nmuch engaged in her own room, could see little of what was passing.\\r\\nThe tea things were brought in, and already had Marianne been\\r\\ndisappointed more than once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a\\r\\nloud one was suddenly heard which could not be mistaken for one at any\\r\\nother house, Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby\\'s\\r\\napproach, and Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door. Every\\r\\nthing was silent; this could not be borne many seconds; she opened\\r\\nthe door, advanced a few steps towards the stairs, and after listening\\r\\nhalf a minute, returned into the room in all the agitation which a\\r\\nconviction of having heard him would naturally produce; in the ecstasy\\r\\nof her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming, \"Oh,\\r\\nElinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it is!\" and seemed almost ready to\\r\\nthrow herself into his arms, when Colonel Brandon appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she\\r\\nimmediately left the room. Elinor was disappointed too; but at the\\r\\nsame time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her;\\r\\nand she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister\\r\\nshould perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and\\r\\ndisappointment in seeing him. She instantly saw that it was not\\r\\nunnoticed by him, that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the\\r\\nroom, with such astonishment and concern, as hardly left him the\\r\\nrecollection of what civility demanded towards herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is your sister ill?\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor answered in some distress that she was, and then talked of\\r\\nhead-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to\\r\\nwhich she could decently attribute her sister\\'s behaviour.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe heard her with the most earnest attention, but seeming to recollect\\r\\nhimself, said no more on the subject, and began directly to speak of\\r\\nhis pleasure at seeing them in London, making the usual inquiries\\r\\nabout their journey, and the friends they had left behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side,\\r\\nthey continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughts\\r\\nof both engaged elsewhere. Elinor wished very much to ask whether\\r\\nWilloughby were then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain by\\r\\nany enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way of saying\\r\\nsomething, she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen\\r\\nhim last. \"Yes,\" he replied, with some embarrassment, \"almost ever\\r\\nsince; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it\\r\\nhas never been in my power to return to Barton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, and the manner in which it was said, immediately brought back to\\r\\nher remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place, with\\r\\nthe uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings, and\\r\\nshe was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on\\r\\nthe subject than she had ever felt.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Jennings soon came in. \"Oh! Colonel,\" said she, with her usual\\r\\nnoisy cheerfulness, \"I am monstrous glad to see you--sorry I could not\\r\\ncome before--beg your pardon, but I have been forced to look about me\\r\\na little, and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I have\\r\\nbeen at home, and you know one has always a world of little odd things\\r\\nto do after one has been away for any time; and then I have had\\r\\nCartwright to settle with. Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever\\r\\nsince dinner! But pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I\\r\\nshould be in town today?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer\\'s, where I have been\\r\\ndining.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their house? How does\\r\\nCharlotte do? I warrant you she is a fine size by this time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned to tell you,\\r\\nthat you will certainly see her to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, to be sure, I thought as much. Well, Colonel, I have brought two\\r\\nyoung ladies with me, you see--that is, you see but one of them now,\\r\\nbut there is another somewhere. Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--which\\r\\nyou will not be sorry to hear. I do not know what you and Mr.\\r\\nWilloughby will do between you about her. Ay, it is a fine thing to be\\r\\nyoung and handsome. Well! I was young once, but I never was very\\r\\nhandsome--worse luck for me. However, I got a very good husband, and I\\r\\ndon\\'t know what the greatest beauty can do more. Ah! poor man! he has\\r\\nbeen dead these eight years and better. But Colonel, where have you\\r\\nbeen to since we parted? And how does your business go on? Come, come,\\r\\nlet\\'s have no secrets among friends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries, but\\r\\nwithout satisfying her in any. Elinor now began to make the tea, and\\r\\nMarianne was obliged to appear again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter her entrance, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent\\r\\nthan he had been before, and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to\\r\\nstay long. No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies were\\r\\nunanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks.\\r\\nThe disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the\\r\\nexpectation of what was to happen that day. They had not long finished\\r\\ntheir breakfast before Mrs. Palmer\\'s barouche stopped at the door, and\\r\\nin a few minutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted to see\\r\\nthem all, that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure\\r\\nfrom meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again. So surprised at\\r\\ntheir coming to town, though it was what she had rather expected all\\r\\nalong; so angry at their accepting her mother\\'s invitation after\\r\\nhaving declined her own, though at the same time she would never have\\r\\nforgiven them if they had not come!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you,\" said she; \"What do you think\\r\\nhe said when he heard of your coming with Mamma? I forget what it was\\r\\nnow, but it was something so droll!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat,\\r\\nor in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all their\\r\\nacquaintance on Mrs. Jennings\\'s side, and in laughter without cause on\\r\\nMrs. Palmer\\'s, it was proposed by the latter that they should all\\r\\naccompany her to some shops where she had business that morning, to\\r\\nwhich Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented, as having likewise\\r\\nsome purchases to make themselves; and Marianne, though declining it\\r\\nat first was induced to go likewise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWherever they went, she was evidently always on the watch. In Bond\\r\\nStreet especially, where much of their business lay, her eyes were in\\r\\nconstant inquiry; and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her\\r\\nmind was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them,\\r\\nfrom all that interested and occupied the others. Restless and\\r\\ndissatisfied every where, her sister could never obtain her opinion of\\r\\nany article of purchase, however it might equally concern them both:\\r\\nshe received no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at\\r\\nhome again, and could with difficulty govern her vexation at the\\r\\ntediousness of Mrs. Palmer, whose eye was caught by every thing\\r\\npretty, expensive, or new; who was wild to buy all, could determine on\\r\\nnone, and dawdled away her time in rapture and indecision.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was late in the morning before they returned home; and no sooner\\r\\nhad they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs, and\\r\\nwhen Elinor followed, she found her turning from the table with a\\r\\nsorrowful countenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been\\r\\nthere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?\" said she to\\r\\nthe footman who then entered with the parcels. She was answered in the\\r\\nnegative. \"Are you quite sure of it?\" she replied. \"Are you certain\\r\\nthat no servant, no porter has left any letter or note?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man replied that none had.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How very odd!\" said she, in a low and disappointed voice, as she\\r\\nturned away to the window.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How odd, indeed!\" repeated Elinor within herself, regarding her\\r\\nsister with uneasiness. \"If she had not known him to be in town she\\r\\nwould not have written to him, as she did; she would have written to\\r\\nCombe Magna; and if he is in town, how odd that he should neither come\\r\\nnor write! Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong in permitting an\\r\\nengagement between a daughter so young, a man so little known, to be\\r\\ncarried on in so doubtful, so mysterious a manner! I long to inquire;\\r\\nand how will _my_ interference be borne.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe determined, after some consideration, that if appearances\\r\\ncontinued many days longer as unpleasant as they now were, she would\\r\\nrepresent in the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some\\r\\nserious enquiry into the affair.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings\\'s intimate\\r\\nacquaintance, whom she had met and invited in the morning, dined with\\r\\nthem. The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening\\r\\nengagements; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table\\r\\nfor the others. Marianne was of no use on these occasions, as she\\r\\nwould never learn the game; but though her time was therefore at her\\r\\nown disposal, the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure\\r\\nto her than to Elinor, for it was spent in all the anxiety of\\r\\nexpectation and the pain of disappointment. She sometimes endeavoured\\r\\nfor a few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside, and she\\r\\nreturned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and\\r\\nforwards across the room, pausing for a moment whenever she came to\\r\\nthe window, in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If this open weather holds much longer,\" said Mrs. Jennings, when\\r\\nthey met at breakfast the following morning, \"Sir John will not like\\r\\nleaving Barton next week; \\'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a\\r\\nday\\'s pleasure. Poor souls! I always pity them when they do; they seem\\r\\nto take it so much to heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is true,\" cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice, and walking to\\r\\nthe window as she spoke, to examine the day. \"I had not thought of\\r\\nthat. This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were restored by it.\\r\\n\"It is charming weather for _them_ indeed,\" she continued, as she sat\\r\\ndown to the breakfast table with a happy countenance. \"How much they\\r\\nmust enjoy it! But\" (with a little return of anxiety) \"it cannot be\\r\\nexpected to last long. At this time of the year, and after such a\\r\\nseries of rain, we shall certainly have very little more of it. Frosts\\r\\nwill soon set in, and in all probability with severity. In another day\\r\\nor two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer--nay,\\r\\nperhaps it may freeze tonight!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At any rate,\" said Elinor, wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from\\r\\nseeing her sister\\'s thoughts as clearly as she did, \"I dare say we\\r\\nshall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next\\r\\nweek.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, my dear, I\\'ll warrant you we do. Mary always has her own way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now,\" silently conjectured Elinor, \"she will write to Combe by\\r\\nthis day\\'s post.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if she _did_, the letter was written and sent away with a privacy\\r\\nwhich eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact. Whatever the\\r\\ntruth of it might be, and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough\\r\\ncontentment about it, yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could\\r\\nnot be very uncomfortable herself. And Marianne was in spirits; happy\\r\\nin the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her expectation\\r\\nof a frost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs.\\r\\nJennings\\'s acquaintance to inform them of her being in town; and\\r\\nMarianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind,\\r\\nwatching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the\\r\\nair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you find it colder than it was in the morning, Elinor? There\\r\\nseems to me a very decided difference. I can hardly keep my hands warm\\r\\neven in my muff. It was not so yesterday, I think. The clouds seem\\r\\nparting too, the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a\\r\\nclear afternoon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor was alternately diverted and pained; but Marianne persevered,\\r\\nand saw every night in the brightness of the fire, and every morning\\r\\nin the appearance of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of\\r\\napproaching frost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs.\\r\\nJennings\\'s style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with her\\r\\nbehaviour to themselves, which was invariably kind. Every thing in her\\r\\nhousehold arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan, and\\r\\nexcepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middleton\\'s regret,\\r\\nshe had never dropped, she visited no one to whom an introduction\\r\\ncould at all discompose the feelings of her young companions. Pleased\\r\\nto find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she\\r\\nhad expected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much\\r\\nreal enjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at\\r\\nhome or abroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Brandon, who had a general invitation to the house, was with\\r\\nthem almost every day; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor,\\r\\nwho often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from\\r\\nany other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time with much\\r\\nconcern his continued regard for her sister. She feared it was a\\r\\nstrengthening regard. It grieved her to see the earnestness with which\\r\\nhe often watched Marianne, and his spirits were certainly worse than\\r\\nwhen at Barton.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout a week after their arrival, it became certain that Willoughby\\r\\nwas also arrived. His card was on the table when they came in from the\\r\\nmorning\\'s drive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good God!\" cried Marianne, \"he has been here while we were out.\"\\r\\nElinor, rejoiced to be assured of his being in London, now ventured\\r\\nto say, \"Depend upon it, he will call again tomorrow.\" But Marianne\\r\\nseemed hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jennings\\'s entrance, escaped\\r\\nwith the precious card.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor, restored to those\\r\\nof her sister all, and more than all, their former agitation. From\\r\\nthis moment her mind was never quiet; the expectation of seeing him\\r\\nevery hour of the day, made her unfit for any thing. She insisted on\\r\\nbeing left behind, the next morning, when the others went out.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor\\'s thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley\\r\\nStreet during their absence; but a moment\\'s glance at her sister when\\r\\nthey returned was enough to inform her, that Willoughby had paid no\\r\\nsecond visit there. A note was just then brought in, and laid on the\\r\\ntable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For me!\" cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am, for my mistress.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are expecting a letter, then?\" said Elinor, unable to be longer\\r\\nsilent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, a little--not much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a short pause. \"You have no confidence in me, Marianne.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, Elinor, this reproach from _you_--you who have confidence in no\\r\\none!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Me!\" returned Elinor in some confusion; \"indeed, Marianne, I have\\r\\nnothing to tell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor I,\" answered Marianne with energy, \"our situations then are\\r\\nalike. We have neither of us any thing to tell; you, because you do\\r\\nnot communicate, and I, because I conceal nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself, which she was\\r\\nnot at liberty to do away, knew not how, under such circumstances, to\\r\\npress for greater openness in Marianne.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her, she read it\\r\\naloud. It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in Conduit\\r\\nStreet the night before, and requesting the company of her mother and\\r\\ncousins the following evening. Business on Sir John\\'s part, and a\\r\\nviolent cold on her own, prevented their calling in Berkeley Street.\\r\\nThe invitation was accepted; but when the hour of appointment drew\\r\\nnear, necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that\\r\\nthey should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some\\r\\ndifficulty in persuading her sister to go, for still she had seen\\r\\nnothing of Willoughby; and therefore was not more indisposed for\\r\\namusement abroad, than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again\\r\\nin her absence.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is not\\r\\nmaterially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settled\\r\\nin town, Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty\\r\\nyoung people, and to amuse them with a ball. This was an affair,\\r\\nhowever, of which Lady Middleton did not approve. In the country, an\\r\\nunpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where the\\r\\nreputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, it\\r\\nwas risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have it\\r\\nknown that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine\\r\\ncouple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former, whom they had\\r\\nnot seen before since their arrival in town, as he was careful to\\r\\navoid the appearance of any attention to his mother-in-law, and\\r\\ntherefore never came near her, they received no mark of recognition on\\r\\ntheir entrance. He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know\\r\\nwho they were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side\\r\\nof the room. Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she\\r\\nentered: it was enough--_he_ was not there--and she sat down, equally\\r\\nill-disposed to receive or communicate pleasure. After they had been\\r\\nassembled about an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss\\r\\nDashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town, though\\r\\nColonel Brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house,\\r\\nand he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were\\r\\nto come.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought you were both in Devonshire,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you?\" replied Elinor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When do you go back again?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know.\" And thus ended their discourse.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life, as she was\\r\\nthat evening, and never so much fatigued by the exercise. She\\r\\ncomplained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, aye,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"we know the reason of all that very\\r\\nwell; if a certain person who shall be nameless, had been there, you\\r\\nwould not have been a bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very\\r\\npretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Invited!\" cried Marianne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir John met him\\r\\nsomewhere in the street this morning.\" Marianne said no more, but\\r\\nlooked exceedingly hurt. Impatient in this situation to be doing\\r\\nsomething that might lead to her sister\\'s relief, Elinor resolved to\\r\\nwrite the next morning to her mother, and hoped by awakening her fears\\r\\nfor the health of Marianne, to procure those inquiries which had been\\r\\nso long delayed; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure\\r\\nby perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne was again\\r\\nwriting to Willoughby, for she could not suppose it to be to any other\\r\\nperson.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on\\r\\nbusiness, and Elinor began her letter directly, while Marianne, too\\r\\nrestless for employment, too anxious for conversation, walked from one\\r\\nwindow to the other, or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.\\r\\nElinor was very earnest in her application to her mother, relating all\\r\\nthat had passed, her suspicions of Willoughby\\'s inconstancy, urging\\r\\nher by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an\\r\\naccount of her real situation with respect to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer letter was scarcely finished, when a rap foretold a visitor, and\\r\\nColonel Brandon was announced. Marianne, who had seen him from the\\r\\nwindow, and who hated company of any kind, left the room before he\\r\\nentered it. He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing\\r\\nsatisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he had somewhat in\\r\\nparticular to tell her, sat for some time without saying a word.\\r\\nElinor, persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her\\r\\nsister was concerned, impatiently expected its opening. It was not the\\r\\nfirst time of her feeling the same kind of conviction; for, more than\\r\\nonce before, beginning with the observation of \"your sister looks\\r\\nunwell to-day,\" or \"your sister seems out of spirits,\" he had\\r\\nappeared on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring,\\r\\nsomething particular about her. After a pause of several minutes,\\r\\ntheir silence was broken, by his asking her in a voice of some\\r\\nagitation, when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a\\r\\nbrother? Elinor was not prepared for such a question, and having no\\r\\nanswer ready, was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient, of\\r\\nasking what he meant? He tried to smile as he replied, \"your sister\\'s\\r\\nengagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It cannot be generally known,\" returned Elinor, \"for her own family\\r\\ndo not know it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked surprised and said, \"I beg your pardon, I am afraid my\\r\\ninquiry has been impertinent; but I had not supposed any secrecy\\r\\nintended, as they openly correspond, and their marriage is universally\\r\\ntalked of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can that be? By whom can you have heard it mentioned?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By many--by some of whom you know nothing, by others with whom you\\r\\nare most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons. But\\r\\nstill I might not have believed it, for where the mind is perhaps\\r\\nrather unwilling to be convinced, it will always find something to\\r\\nsupport its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,\\r\\naccidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to Mr. Willoughby in\\r\\nyour sister\\'s writing. I came to inquire, but I was convinced before I\\r\\ncould ask the question. Is every thing finally settled? Is it\\r\\nimpossible to-? But I have no right, and I could have no chance of\\r\\nsucceeding. Excuse me, Miss Dashwood. I believe I have been wrong in\\r\\nsaying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on your prudence I\\r\\nhave the strongest dependence. Tell me that it is all absolutely\\r\\nresolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, if\\r\\nconcealment be possible, is all that remains.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for\\r\\nher sister, affected her very much. She was not immediately able to\\r\\nsay anything, and even when her spirits were recovered, she debated\\r\\nfor a short time, on the answer it would be most proper to give. The\\r\\nreal state of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little\\r\\nknown to herself, that in endeavouring to explain it, she might be as\\r\\nliable to say too much as too little. Yet as she was convinced that\\r\\nMarianne\\'s affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel\\r\\nBrandon\\'s success, whatever the event of that affection might be, and\\r\\nat the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure, she\\r\\nthought it most prudent and kind, after some consideration, to say\\r\\nmore than she really knew or believed. She acknowledged, therefore,\\r\\nthat though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on\\r\\nwhich they stood with each other, of their mutual affection she had no\\r\\ndoubt, and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe listened to her with silent attention, and on her ceasing to speak,\\r\\nrose directly from his seat, and after saying in a voice of emotion,\\r\\n\"to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he\\r\\nmay endeavour to deserve her,\"--took leave, and went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation, to\\r\\nlessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points; she was left, on\\r\\nthe contrary, with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon\\'s\\r\\nunhappiness, and was prevented even from wishing it removed, by her\\r\\nanxiety for the very event that must confirm it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing occurred during the next three or four days, to make Elinor\\r\\nregret what she had done, in applying to her mother; for Willoughby\\r\\nneither came nor wrote. They were engaged about the end of that time\\r\\nto attend Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was kept\\r\\naway by the indisposition of her youngest daughter; and for this\\r\\nparty, Marianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her appearance, and\\r\\nseeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid, prepared,\\r\\nwithout one look of hope or one expression of pleasure. She sat by the\\r\\ndrawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady Middleton\\'s\\r\\narrival, without once stirring from her seat, or altering her\\r\\nattitude, lost in her own thoughts, and insensible of her sister\\'s\\r\\npresence; and when at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited\\r\\nfor them at the door, she started as if she had forgotten that any one\\r\\nwas expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey arrived in due time at the place of destination, and as soon as\\r\\nthe string of carriages before them would allow, alighted, ascended\\r\\nthe stairs, heard their names announced from one landing-place to\\r\\nanother in an audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up,\\r\\nquite full of company, and insufferably hot. When they had paid their\\r\\ntribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house, they were\\r\\npermitted to mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat and\\r\\ninconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add. After some\\r\\ntime spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat down to\\r\\nCassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about, she and\\r\\nElinor luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no great\\r\\ndistance from the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor perceived\\r\\nWilloughby, standing within a few yards of them, in earnest\\r\\nconversation with a very fashionable looking young woman. She soon\\r\\ncaught his eye, and he immediately bowed, but without attempting to\\r\\nspeak to her, or to approach Marianne, though he could not but see\\r\\nher; and then continued his discourse with the same lady. Elinor\\r\\nturned involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether it could be\\r\\nunobserved by her. At that moment she first perceived him, and her\\r\\nwhole countenance glowing with sudden delight, she would have moved\\r\\ntowards him instantly, had not her sister caught hold of her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens!\" she exclaimed, \"he is there--he is there--Oh! why does\\r\\nhe not look at me? why cannot I speak to him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray, pray be composed,\" cried Elinor, \"and do not betray what you\\r\\nfeel to every body present. Perhaps he has not observed you yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis however was more than she could believe herself; and to be\\r\\ncomposed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne,\\r\\nit was beyond her wish. She sat in an agony of impatience which\\r\\naffected every feature.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _At that moment she first perceived him._]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last he turned round again, and regarded them both; she started up,\\r\\nand pronouncing his name in a tone of affection, held out her hand to\\r\\nhim. He approached, and addressing himself rather to Elinor than\\r\\nMarianne, as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to\\r\\nobserve her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs.\\r\\nDashwood, and asked how long they had been in town. Elinor was robbed\\r\\nof all presence of mind by such an address, and was unable to say a\\r\\nword. But the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed. Her\\r\\nface was crimsoned over, and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest\\r\\nemotion, \"Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this? Have you\\r\\nnot received my letters? Will you not shake hands with me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed painful to him, and\\r\\nhe held her hand only for a moment. During all this time he was\\r\\nevidently struggling for composure. Elinor watched his countenance and\\r\\nsaw its expression becoming more tranquil. After a moment\\'s pause, he\\r\\nspoke with calmness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday,\\r\\nand very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find\\r\\nyourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home. My card was not lost, I hope.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But have you not received my notes?\" cried Marianne in the wildest\\r\\nanxiety. \"Here is some mistake I am sure--some dreadful mistake. What\\r\\ncan be the meaning of it? Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven\\'s sake tell\\r\\nme, what is the matter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no reply; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment\\r\\nreturned; but as if, on catching the eye of the young lady with whom\\r\\nhe had been previously talking, he felt the necessity of instant\\r\\nexertion, he recovered himself again, and after saying, \"Yes, I had\\r\\nthe pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town,\\r\\nwhich you were so good as to send me,\" turned hastily away with a\\r\\nslight bow and joined his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable to stand, sunk into\\r\\nher chair, and Elinor, expecting every moment to see her faint, tried\\r\\nto screen her from the observation of others, while reviving her with\\r\\nlavender water.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go to him, Elinor,\" she cried, as soon as she could speak, \"and force\\r\\nhim to come to me. Tell him I must see him again--must speak to him\\r\\ninstantly. I cannot rest--I shall not have a moment\\'s peace till this\\r\\nis explained--some dreadful misapprehension or other. Oh, go to him\\r\\nthis moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne, you must wait. This is\\r\\nnot the place for explanations. Wait only till tomorrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith difficulty however could she prevent her from following him\\r\\nherself; and to persuade her to check her agitation, to wait, at\\r\\nleast, with the appearance of composure, till she might speak to him\\r\\nwith more privacy and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne\\r\\ncontinued incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her\\r\\nfeelings, by exclamations of wretchedness. In a short time Elinor saw\\r\\nWilloughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase, and\\r\\ntelling Marianne that he was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking\\r\\nto him again that evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm. She\\r\\ninstantly begged her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them\\r\\nhome, as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber, on being informed\\r\\nthat Marianne was unwell, was too polite to object for a moment to her\\r\\nwish of going away, and making over her cards to a friend, they\\r\\ndeparted as soon as the carriage could be found. Scarcely a word was\\r\\nspoken during their return to Berkeley Street. Marianne was in a\\r\\nsilent agony, too much oppressed even for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings\\r\\nwas luckily not come home, they could go directly to their own room,\\r\\nwhere hartshorn restored her a little to herself. She was soon\\r\\nundressed and in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone, her\\r\\nsister then left her, and while she waited the return of Mrs.\\r\\nJennings, had leisure enough for thinking over the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and\\r\\nMarianne she could not doubt, and that Willoughby was weary of it,\\r\\nseemed equally clear; for however Marianne might still feed her own\\r\\nwishes, _she_ could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or\\r\\nmisapprehension of any kind. Nothing but a thorough change of\\r\\nsentiment could account for it. Her indignation would have been still\\r\\nstronger than it was, had she not witnessed that embarrassment which\\r\\nseemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented\\r\\nher from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with\\r\\nthe affections of her sister from the first, without any design that\\r\\nwould bear investigation. Absence might have weakened his regard, and\\r\\nconvenience might have determined him to overcome it, but that such a\\r\\nregard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already\\r\\nhave given her, and on those still more severe which might await her\\r\\nin its probable consequence, she could not reflect without the deepest\\r\\nconcern. Her own situation gained in the comparison; for while she\\r\\ncould _esteem_ Edward as much as ever, however they might be divided\\r\\nin future, her mind might be always supported. But every circumstance\\r\\nthat could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery\\r\\nof Marianne in a final separation from Willoughby--in an immediate and\\r\\nirreconcilable rupture with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the housemaid had lit their fire the next day, or the sun\\r\\ngained any power over a cold, gloomy morning in January, Marianne,\\r\\nonly half dressed, was kneeling against one of the window-seats for\\r\\nthe sake of all the little light she could command from it, and\\r\\nwriting as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her. In this\\r\\nsituation, Elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs, first\\r\\nperceived her; and after observing her for a few moments with silent\\r\\nanxiety, said, in a tone of the most considerate gentleness--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marianne, may I ask--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Elinor,\" she replied, \"ask nothing; you will soon know all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sort of desperate calmness with which this was said, lasted no\\r\\nlonger than while she spoke, and was immediately followed by a return\\r\\nof the same excessive affliction. It was some minutes before she could\\r\\ngo on with her letter, and the frequent bursts of grief which still\\r\\nobliged her, at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of\\r\\nher feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the\\r\\nlast time to Willoughby.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power;\\r\\nand she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more, had\\r\\nnot Marianne entreated her, with all the eagerness of the most nervous\\r\\nirritability, not to speak to her for the world. In such\\r\\ncircumstances, it was better for both that they should not be long\\r\\ntogether; and the restless state of Marianne\\'s mind not only prevented\\r\\nher from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed, but\\r\\nrequiring at once solitude and continual change of place, made her\\r\\nwander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding the sight of\\r\\nevery body.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat any thing; and\\r\\nElinor\\'s attention was then all employed, not in urging her, not in\\r\\npitying her, nor in appearing to regard her, but in endeavouring to\\r\\nengage Mrs. Jennings\\'s notice entirely to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings, it lasted a\\r\\nconsiderable time, and they were just setting themselves, after it,\\r\\nround the common working table, when a letter was delivered to\\r\\nMarianne, which she eagerly caught from the servant, and, turning of a\\r\\ndeath-like paleness, instantly ran out of the room. Elinor, who saw as\\r\\nplainly by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must come\\r\\nfrom Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her\\r\\nhardly able to hold up her head, and sat in such a general tremor as\\r\\nmade her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jennings\\'s notice. That\\r\\ngood lady, however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter from\\r\\nWilloughby, which appeared to her a very good joke, and which she\\r\\ntreated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh, that she would find it\\r\\nto her liking. Of Elinor\\'s distress, she was too busily employed in\\r\\nmeasuring lengths of worsted for her rug, to see any thing at all; and\\r\\ncalmly continuing her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she\\r\\nsaid--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my\\r\\nlife! _My_ girls were nothing to her, and yet they used to be foolish\\r\\nenough; but as for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature. I\\r\\nhope, from the bottom of my heart, he won\\'t keep her waiting much\\r\\nlonger, for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn.\\r\\nPray, when are they to be married?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor, though never less disposed to speak than at that moment,\\r\\nobliged herself to answer such an attack as this, and, therefore,\\r\\ntrying to smile, replied, \"And have you really, Ma\\'am, talked yourself\\r\\ninto a persuasion of my sister\\'s being engaged to Mr. Willoughby? I\\r\\nthought it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems to\\r\\nimply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not deceive\\r\\nyourself any longer. I do assure you that nothing would surprise me\\r\\nmore than to hear of their being going to be married.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can you talk so? Don\\'t we\\r\\nall know that it must be a match, that they were over head and ears in\\r\\nlove with each other from the first moment they met? Did not I see\\r\\nthem together in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I\\r\\nknow that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding\\r\\nclothes? Come, come, this won\\'t do. Because you are so sly about it\\r\\nyourself, you think nobody else has any senses; but it is no such\\r\\nthing, I can tell you, for it has been known all over town this ever\\r\\nso long. I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Ma\\'am,\" said Elinor, very seriously, \"you are mistaken.\\r\\nIndeed, you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report, and\\r\\nyou will find that you have though you will not believe me now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had not spirits to say more,\\r\\nand eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written, hurried\\r\\naway to their room, where, on opening the door, she saw Marianne\\r\\nstretched on the bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her hand,\\r\\nand two or three others laying by her. Elinor drew near, but without\\r\\nsaying a word; and seating herself on the bed, took her hand, kissed\\r\\nher affectionately several times, and then gave way to a burst of\\r\\ntears, which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne\\'s. The\\r\\nlatter, though unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness of\\r\\nthis behaviour, and after some time thus spent in joint affliction,\\r\\nshe put all the letters into Elinor\\'s hands; and then covering her\\r\\nface with her handkerchief, almost screamed with agony. Elinor, who\\r\\nknew that such grief, shocking as it was to witness it, must have its\\r\\ncourse, watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat\\r\\nspent itself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughby\\'s letter, read as\\r\\nfollows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bond Street, January.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR MADAM,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I have just had the honour of receiving your letter, for\\r\\n     which I beg to return my sincere acknowledgments. I am much\\r\\n     concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last\\r\\n     night that did not meet your approbation; and though I am\\r\\n     quite at a loss to discover in what point I could be so\\r\\n     unfortunate as to offend you, I entreat your forgiveness of\\r\\n     what I can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional.\\r\\n     I shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your\\r\\n     family in Devonshire without the most grateful pleasure, and\\r\\n     flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or\\r\\n     misapprehension of my actions. My esteem for your whole\\r\\n     family is very sincere; but if I have been so unfortunate as\\r\\n     to give rise to a belief of more than I felt, or meant to\\r\\n     express, I shall reproach myself for not having been more\\r\\n     guarded in my professions of that esteem. That I should ever\\r\\n     have meant more you will allow to be impossible, when you\\r\\n     understand that my affections have been long engaged\\r\\n     elsewhere, and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before\\r\\n     this engagement is fulfilled. It is with great regret that I\\r\\n     obey your commands in returning the letters with which I\\r\\n     have been honoured from you, and the lock of hair, which you\\r\\n     so obligingly bestowed on me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am, dear Madam,\\r\\n\\r\\nYour most obedient humble servant,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"JOHN WILLOUGHBY.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss\\r\\nDashwood, may be imagined. Though aware, before she began it, that it\\r\\nmust bring a confession of his inconstancy, and confirm their\\r\\nseparation for ever, she was not aware that such language could be\\r\\nsuffered to announce it; nor could she have supposed Willoughby\\r\\ncapable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable\\r\\nand delicate feeling--so far from the common decorum of a gentleman,\\r\\nas to send a letter so impudently cruel: a letter which, instead of\\r\\nbringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret,\\r\\nacknowledged no breach of faith, denied all peculiar affection\\r\\nwhatever;--a letter of which every line was an insult, and which\\r\\nproclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment; then\\r\\nread it again and again; but every perusal only served to increase\\r\\nher abhorrence of the man, and so bitter were her feelings against\\r\\nhim, that she dared not trust herself to speak, lest she might wound\\r\\nMarianne still deeper by treating their disengagement, not as a loss\\r\\nto her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most\\r\\nirremediable of all evils,--a connection, for life, with an\\r\\nunprincipled man, as a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most\\r\\nimportant.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter, on the\\r\\ndepravity of that mind which could dictate it, and probably, on the\\r\\nvery different mind of a very different person, who had no other\\r\\nconnection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with\\r\\nevery thing that passed, Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her\\r\\nsister, forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread, and\\r\\nso entirely forgot how long she had been in the room, that when on\\r\\nhearing a carriage drive up to the door, she went to the window to see\\r\\nwho could be coming so unreasonably early, she was all astonishment to\\r\\nperceive Mrs. Jennings\\'s chariot, which she knew had not been ordered\\r\\ntill one. Determined not to quit Marianne, though hopeless of\\r\\ncontributing, at present, to her ease, she hurried away to excuse\\r\\nherself from attending Mrs. Jennings, on account of her sister being\\r\\nindisposed. Mrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern for\\r\\nits cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor, after seeing\\r\\nher safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she found attempting to rise\\r\\nfrom the bed, and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from\\r\\nfalling on the floor, faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest\\r\\nand food; for it was many days since she had any appetite, and many\\r\\nnights since she had really slept; and now, when her mind was no\\r\\nlonger supported by the fever of suspense, the consequence of all this\\r\\nwas felt in an aching head, a weakened stomach, and a general nervous\\r\\nfaintness. A glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her directly,\\r\\nmade her more comfortable, and she was at last able to express some\\r\\nsense of her kindness, by saying, \"Poor Elinor! how unhappy I make\\r\\nyou!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I only wish,\" replied her sister, \"there were any thing I _could_ do,\\r\\nwhich might be of comfort to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, as every thing else would have been, was too much for Marianne,\\r\\nwho could only exclaim, in the anguish of her heart, \"Oh! Elinor, I\\r\\nam miserable, indeed,\" before her voice was entirely lost in sobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in\\r\\nsilence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exert yourself, dear Marianne,\" she cried, \"if you would not kill\\r\\nyourself and all who love you. Think of your mother; think of her\\r\\nmisery while _you_ suffer: for her sake you must exert yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot, I cannot,\" cried Marianne; \"leave me, leave me, if I\\r\\ndistress you; leave me, hate me, forget me! but do not torture me so.\\r\\nOh! how easy for those, who have no sorrow of their own to talk of\\r\\nexertion! Happy, happy Elinor, _you_ cannot have an idea of what I\\r\\nsuffer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you call _me_ happy, Marianne? Ah! if you knew! And can you\\r\\nbelieve me to be so, while I see you so wretched!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Forgive me, forgive me,\" throwing her arms round her sister\\'s neck;\\r\\n\"I know you feel for me; I know what a heart you have; but yet you\\r\\nare--you must be happy; Edward loves you--what, oh what, can do away\\r\\nsuch happiness as that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Many, many circumstances,\" said Elinor, solemnly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, no,\" cried Marianne wildly, \"he loves you, and only you. You\\r\\n_can_ have no grief.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you will never see me otherwise. Mine is a misery which nothing\\r\\ncan do away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must not talk so, Marianne. Have you no comforts? no friends? Is\\r\\nyour loss such as leaves no opening for consolation? Much as you\\r\\nsuffer now, think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of\\r\\nhis character had been delayed to a later period;--if your engagement\\r\\nhad been carried on for months and months, as it might have been,\\r\\nbefore he chose to put an end to it. Every additional day of unhappy\\r\\nconfidence, on your side, would have made the blow more dreadful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Engagement!\" cried Marianne, \"there has been no engagement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No engagement!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, he is not so unworthy as you believe him. He has broken no faith\\r\\nwith me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he told you that he loved you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes--no--never absolutely. It was every day implied, but never\\r\\nprofessedly declared. Sometimes I thought it had been--but it never\\r\\nwas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet you wrote to him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes: could that be wrong after all that had passed? But I cannot\\r\\ntalk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor said no more, and turning again to the three letters which now\\r\\nraised a much stronger curiosity than before, directly ran over the\\r\\ncontents of all. The first, which was what her sister had sent him on\\r\\ntheir arrival in town, was to this effect:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Berkeley Street, January.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"How surprised you will be, Willoughby, on receiving this;\\r\\n     and I think you will feel something more than surprise, when\\r\\n     you know that I am in town. An opportunity of coming hither,\\r\\n     though with Mrs. Jennings, was a temptation we could not\\r\\n     resist. I wish you may receive this in time to come here\\r\\n     tonight, but I will not depend on it. At any rate I shall\\r\\n     expect you to-morrow. For the present, adieu.\\r\\n\\r\\nM.D.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer second note, which had been written on the morning after the dance\\r\\nat the Middletons\\', was in these words:--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I cannot express my disappointment in having missed you the\\r\\n     day before yesterday, nor my astonishment at not having\\r\\n     received any answer to a note which I sent you above a week\\r\\n     ago. I have been expecting to hear from you, and still more\\r\\n     to see you, every hour of the day. Pray call again as soon\\r\\n     as possible, and explain the reason of my having expected\\r\\n     this in vain. You had better come earlier another time,\\r\\n     because we are generally out by one. We were last night at\\r\\n     Lady Middleton\\'s, where there was a dance. I have been told\\r\\n     that you were asked to be of the party. But could it be so?\\r\\n     You must be very much altered indeed since we parted, if\\r\\n     that could be the case, and you not there. But I will not\\r\\n     suppose this possible, and I hope very soon to receive your\\r\\n     personal assurance of its being otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nM.D.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contents of her last note to him were these:--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"What am I to imagine, Willoughby, by your behaviour last\\r\\n     night? Again I demand an explanation of it. I was prepared\\r\\n     to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally\\r\\n     produced,--with the familiarity which our intimacy at Barton\\r\\n     appeared to me to justify. I was repulsed indeed! I have\\r\\n     passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a conduct\\r\\n     which can scarcely be called less than insulting; but though\\r\\n     I have not yet been able to form any reasonable apology for\\r\\n     your behaviour, I am perfectly ready to hear your\\r\\n     justification of it. You have perhaps been misinformed, or\\r\\n     purposely deceived, in something concerning me, which may\\r\\n     have lowered me in your opinion. Tell me what it is, explain\\r\\n     the grounds on which you acted, and I shall be satisfied, in\\r\\n     being able to satisfy you. It would grieve me indeed to be\\r\\n     obliged to think ill of you; but if I am to do it, if I am\\r\\n     to learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed\\r\\n     you, that your regard for us all was insincere, that your\\r\\n     behaviour to me was intended only to deceive, let it be told\\r\\n     as soon as possible. My feelings are at present in a state\\r\\n     of dreadful indecision; I wish to acquit you, but certainty\\r\\n     on either side will be ease to what I now suffer. If your\\r\\n     sentiments are no longer what they were, you will return my\\r\\n     notes, and the lock of my hair which is in your possession.\\r\\n\\r\\nM.D.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat such letters, so full of affection and confidence, could have\\r\\nbeen so answered, Elinor, for Willoughby\\'s sake, would have been\\r\\nunwilling to believe. But her condemnation of him did not blind her to\\r\\nthe impropriety of their having been written at all; and she was\\r\\nsilently grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such\\r\\nunsolicited proofs of tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding,\\r\\nand most severely condemned by the event, when Marianne, perceiving\\r\\nthat she had finished the letters, observed to her that they contained\\r\\nnothing but what any one would have written in the same situation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I felt myself,\" she added, \"to be as solemnly engaged to him, as if\\r\\nthe strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can believe it,\" said Elinor; \"but unfortunately he did not feel\\r\\nthe same.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He _did_ feel the same, Elinor--for weeks and weeks he felt it. I\\r\\nknow he did. Whatever may have changed him now, (and nothing but the\\r\\nblackest art employed against me can have done it), I was once as dear\\r\\nto him as my own soul could wish. This lock of hair, which now he can\\r\\nso readily give up, was begged of me with the most earnest\\r\\nsupplication. Had you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his\\r\\nvoice at that moment! Have you forgot the last evening of our being\\r\\ntogether at Barton? The morning that we parted too! When he told me\\r\\nthat it might be many weeks before we met again--his distress--can I\\r\\never forget his distress?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment or two she could say no more; but when this emotion had\\r\\npassed away, she added, in a firmer tone--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dearest Marianne, who but himself? By whom can he have been\\r\\ninstigated?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By all the world, rather than by his own heart. I could rather\\r\\nbelieve every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me\\r\\nin his opinion, than believe his nature capable of such cruelty. This\\r\\nwoman of whom he writes--whoever she be--or any one, in short, but\\r\\nyour own dear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous to\\r\\nbely me. Beyond you three, is there a creature in the world whom I\\r\\nwould not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby, whose heart I know\\r\\nso well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor would not contend, and only replied, \"Whoever may have been so\\r\\ndetestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph,\\r\\nmy dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own\\r\\ninnocence and good intentions supports your spirits. It is a\\r\\nreasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" cried Marianne, \"misery such as mine has no pride. I care\\r\\nnot who knows that I am wretched. The triumph of seeing me so may be\\r\\nopen to all the world. Elinor, Elinor, they who suffer little may be\\r\\nproud and independent as they like--may resist insult, or return\\r\\nmortification--but I cannot. I must feel--I must be wretched--and they\\r\\nare welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But for my mother\\'s sake and mine--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would do more than for my own. But to appear happy when I am so\\r\\nmiserable--oh! who can require it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain they were both silent. Elinor was employed in walking\\r\\nthoughtfully from the fire to the window, from the window to the fire,\\r\\nwithout knowing that she received warmth from one, or discerning\\r\\nobjects through the other; and Marianne, seated at the foot of the\\r\\nbed, with her head leaning against one of its posts, again took up\\r\\nWilloughby\\'s letter, and, after shuddering over every sentence,\\r\\nexclaimed--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this be yours!\\r\\nCruel, cruel--nothing can acquit you. Elinor, nothing can. Whatever he\\r\\nmight have heard against me, ought he not to have suspended his\\r\\nbelief? ought he not to have told me of it, to have given me the power\\r\\nof clearing myself? \\'The lock of hair, (repeating it from the letter,)\\r\\nwhich you so obligingly bestowed on me\\'--that is unpardonable.\\r\\nWilloughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words? Oh,\\r\\nbarbarously insolent!--Elinor, can he be justified?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Marianne, in no possible way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet this woman--who knows what her art may have been?--how long\\r\\nit may have been premeditated, and how deeply contrived by her!--Who\\r\\nis she?--Who can she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young\\r\\nand attractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh! no one, no one:--he\\r\\ntalked to me only of myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother pause ensued; Marianne was greatly agitated, and it ended\\r\\nthus:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Elinor, I must go home. I must go and comfort mama. Can not we be\\r\\ngone to-morrow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To-morrow, Marianne!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, why should I stay here? I came only for Willoughby\\'s sake--and\\r\\nnow who cares for me? Who regards me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would be impossible to go to-morrow. We owe Mrs. Jennings much\\r\\nmore than civility; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent\\r\\nsuch a hasty removal as that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well then, another day or two, perhaps; but I cannot stay here long,\\r\\nI cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people.\\r\\nThe Middletons and Palmers--how am I to bear their pity? The pity of\\r\\nsuch a woman as Lady Middleton! Oh, what would _he_ say to that!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor advised her to lie down again, and for a moment she did so; but\\r\\nno attitude could give her ease; and in restless pain of mind and body\\r\\nshe moved from one posture to another, till growing more and more\\r\\nhysterical, her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at\\r\\nall, and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for\\r\\nassistance. Some lavender drops, however, which she was at length\\r\\npersuaded to take, were of use; and from that time till Mrs. Jennings\\r\\nreturned, she continued on the bed quiet and motionless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her return, and\\r\\nwithout waiting to have her request of admittance answered, opened the\\r\\ndoor and walked in with a look of real concern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you do my dear?\" said she in a voice of great compassion to\\r\\nMarianne, who turned away her face without attempting to answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How is she, Miss Dashwood? Poor thing! she looks very bad. No\\r\\nwonder. Ay, it is but too true. He is to be married very soon--a\\r\\ngood-for-nothing fellow! I have no patience with him. Mrs. Taylor told\\r\\nme of it half an hour ago, and she was told it by a particular friend\\r\\nof Miss Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed it;\\r\\nand I was almost ready to sink as it was. Well, said I, all I can say\\r\\nis, that if this be true, he has used a young lady of my acquaintance\\r\\nabominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his\\r\\nheart out. And so I shall always say, my dear, you may depend on it. I\\r\\nhave no notion of men\\'s going on in this way; and if ever I meet him\\r\\nagain, I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a\\r\\nday. But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne--he is not the\\r\\nonly young man in the world worth having; and with your pretty face\\r\\nyou will never want admirers. Well, poor thing! I won\\'t disturb her\\r\\nany longer, for she had better have her cry out at once and have done\\r\\nwith. The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know,\\r\\nand that will amuse her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room, as if she\\r\\nsupposed her young friend\\'s affliction could be increased by noise.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne, to the surprise of her sister, determined on dining with\\r\\nthem. Elinor even advised her against it. But \"no, she would go down;\\r\\nshe could bear it very well, and the bustle about her would be less.\"\\r\\nElinor, pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive,\\r\\nthough believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner,\\r\\nsaid no more; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,\\r\\nwhile Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her into\\r\\nthe dining room as soon as they were summoned to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen there, though looking most wretchedly, she ate more and was\\r\\ncalmer than her sister had expected. Had she tried to speak, or had\\r\\nshe been conscious of half Mrs. Jennings\\'s well-meant but ill-judged\\r\\nattentions to her, this calmness could not have been maintained; but\\r\\nnot a syllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction of her thoughts\\r\\npreserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings\\'s kindness, though its\\r\\neffusions were often distressing, and sometimes almost ridiculous,\\r\\nmade her those acknowledgments, and returned her those civilities,\\r\\nwhich her sister could not make or return for herself. Their good\\r\\nfriend saw that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing was\\r\\ndue to her which might make her at all less so. She treated her\\r\\ntherefore, with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a\\r\\nfavourite child on the last day of its holidays. Marianne was to have\\r\\nthe best place by the fire, was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy\\r\\nin the house, and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the\\r\\nday. Had not Elinor, in the sad countenance of her sister, seen a\\r\\ncheck to all mirth, she could have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\r\\nendeavours to cure a disappointment in love, by a variety of\\r\\nsweetmeats and olives, and a good fire. As soon, however, as the\\r\\nconsciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on\\r\\nMarianne, she could stay no longer. With a hasty exclamation of\\r\\nMisery, and a sign to her sister not to follow her, she directly got\\r\\nup and hurried out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor soul!\" cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she was gone, \"how it\\r\\ngrieves me to see her! And I declare if she is not gone away without\\r\\nfinishing her wine! And the dried cherries too! Lord! nothing seems to\\r\\ndo her any good. I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, I\\r\\nwould send all over the town for it. Well, it is the oddest thing to\\r\\nme, that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill! But when there\\r\\nis plenty of money on one side, and next to none on the other, Lord\\r\\nbless you! they care no more about such things!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The lady then,--Miss Grey I think you called her,--is very rich?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fifty thousand pounds, my dear. Did you ever see her? a smart,\\r\\nstylish girl they say, but not handsome. I remember her aunt very\\r\\nwell, Biddy Henshawe; she married a very wealthy man. But the family\\r\\nare all rich together. Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it\\r\\nwon\\'t come before it\\'s wanted; for they say he is all to pieces. No\\r\\nwonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters! Well, it don\\'t\\r\\nsignify talking; but when a young man, be who he will, comes and makes\\r\\nlove to a pretty girl, and promises marriage, he has no business to\\r\\nfly off from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer girl is\\r\\nready to have him. Why don\\'t he, in such a case, sell his horses, let\\r\\nhis house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once?\\r\\nI warrant you, Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till\\r\\nmatters came round. But that won\\'t do nowadays; nothing in the way\\r\\nof pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is? Is she said to be\\r\\namiable?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever heard her\\r\\nmentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning, that one day\\r\\nMiss Walker hinted to her, that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison\\r\\nwould not be sorry to have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs. Ellison\\r\\ncould never agree.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And who are the Ellisons?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her guardians, my dear. But now she is of age and may choose for\\r\\nherself; and a pretty choice she has made!--What now,\" after pausing a\\r\\nmoment, \"your poor sister is gone to her own room, I suppose, to moan\\r\\nby herself. Is there nothing one can get to comfort her? Poor dear, it\\r\\nseems quite cruel to let her be alone. Well, by and by we shall have a\\r\\nfew friends, and that will amuse her a little. What shall we play at?\\r\\nShe hates whist I know; but is there no round game she cares for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear ma\\'am, this kindness is quite unnecessary. Marianne, I dare say,\\r\\nwill not leave her room again this evening. I shall persuade her if I\\r\\ncan to go early to bed, for I am sure she wants rest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, I believe that will be best for her. Let her name her own\\r\\nsupper, and go to bed. Lord! no wonder she has been looking so bad and\\r\\nso cast down this last week or two, for this matter I suppose has been\\r\\nhanging over her head as long as that. And so the letter that came\\r\\ntoday finished it! Poor soul! I am sure if I had had a notion of it, I\\r\\nwould not have joked her about it for all my money. But then you know,\\r\\nhow should I guess such a thing? I made sure of its being nothing but\\r\\na common love letter, and you know young people like to be laughed at\\r\\nabout them. Lord! how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when\\r\\nthey hear it! If I had my senses about me I might have called in\\r\\nConduit Street in my way home, and told them of it. But I shall see\\r\\nthem to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and\\r\\nSir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby, or making the slightest\\r\\nallusion to what has passed, before my sister. Their own good-nature\\r\\nmust point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing\\r\\nabout it when she is present; and the less that may ever be said to\\r\\nmyself on the subject, the more my feelings will be spared, as you my\\r\\ndear madam will easily believe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Lord! yes, that I do indeed. It must be terrible for you to hear\\r\\nit talked of; and as for your sister, I am sure I would not mention a\\r\\nword about it to her for the world. You saw I did not all dinner time.\\r\\nNo more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are all very\\r\\nthoughtful and considerate; especially if I give them a hint, as I\\r\\ncertainly will. For my part, I think the less that is said about such\\r\\nthings, the better, the sooner \\'tis blown over and forgot. And what\\r\\ndoes talking ever do you know?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In this affair it can only do harm; more so perhaps than in many\\r\\ncases of a similar kind, for it has been attended by circumstances\\r\\nwhich, for the sake of every one concerned in it, make it unfit to\\r\\nbecome the public conversation. I must do _this_ justice to Mr.\\r\\nWilloughby--he has broken no positive engagement with my sister.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Law, my dear! Don\\'t pretend to defend him. No positive engagement\\r\\nindeed! after taking her all over Allenham House, and fixing on the\\r\\nvery rooms they were to live in hereafter!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor, for her sister\\'s sake, could not press the subject farther,\\r\\nand she hoped it was not required of her for Willoughby\\'s; since,\\r\\nthough Marianne might lose much, he could gain very little by the\\r\\nenforcement of the real truth. After a short silence on both sides,\\r\\nMrs. Jennings, with all her natural hilarity, burst forth again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my dear, \\'tis a true saying about an ill wind, for it will be\\r\\nall the better for Colonel Brandon. He will have her at last; aye,\\r\\nthat he will. Mind me, now, if they an\\'t married by Mid-summer. Lord!\\r\\nhow he\\'ll chuckle over this news! I hope he will come tonight. It will\\r\\nbe all to one a better match for your sister. Two thousand a year\\r\\nwithout debt or drawback--except the little love-child, indeed; aye, I\\r\\nhad forgot her; but she may be \\'prenticed out at a small cost, and\\r\\nthen what does it signify? Delaford is a nice place, I can tell you;\\r\\nexactly what I call a nice old fashioned place, full of comforts and\\r\\nconveniences; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered\\r\\nwith the best fruit-trees in the country; and such a mulberry tree in\\r\\none corner! Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were\\r\\nthere! Then, there is a dovecote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a\\r\\nvery pretty canal; and every thing, in short, that one could wish for;\\r\\nand, moreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile\\r\\nfrom the turnpike-road, so \\'tis never dull, for if you only go and sit\\r\\nup in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the\\r\\ncarriages that pass along. Oh! \\'tis a nice place! A butcher hard by in\\r\\nthe village, and the parsonage-house within a stone\\'s throw. To my\\r\\nfancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are\\r\\nforced to send three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour\\r\\nnearer than your mother. Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon\\r\\nas I can. One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down. If we\\r\\n_can_ but put Willoughby out of her head!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, if we can do that, Ma\\'am,\" said Elinor, \"we shall do very well\\r\\nwith or without Colonel Brandon.\" And then rising, she went away to\\r\\njoin Marianne, whom she found, as she expected, in her own room,\\r\\nleaning, in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire, which,\\r\\ntill Elinor\\'s entrance, had been her only light.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You had better leave me,\" was all the notice that her sister received\\r\\nfrom her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will leave you,\" said Elinor, \"if you will go to bed.\" But this,\\r\\nfrom the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering, she at first\\r\\nrefused to do. Her sister\\'s earnest, though gentle persuasion,\\r\\nhowever, soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her lay her\\r\\naching head on the pillow, and as she hoped, in a way to get some\\r\\nquiet rest before she left her.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the drawing-room, whither she then repaired, she was soon joined by\\r\\nMrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass, full of something, in her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear,\" said she, entering, \"I have just recollected that I have\\r\\nsome of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was\\r\\ntasted, so I have brought a glass of it for your sister. My poor\\r\\nhusband! how fond he was of it! Whenever he had a touch of his old\\r\\ncolicky gout, he said it did him more good than any thing else in the\\r\\nworld. Do take it to your sister.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear Ma\\'am,\" replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of the\\r\\ncomplaints for which it was recommended, \"how good you are! But I have\\r\\njust left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think\\r\\nnothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give me\\r\\nleave, I will drink the wine myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been five minutes\\r\\nearlier, was satisfied with the compromise; and Elinor, as she\\r\\nswallowed the chief of it, reflected, that though its effects on a\\r\\ncolicky gout were, at present, of little importance to her, its\\r\\nhealing powers, on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried\\r\\non herself as on her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea, and by his manner\\r\\nof looking round the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately fancied\\r\\nthat he neither expected nor wished to see her there, and, in short,\\r\\nthat he was already aware of what occasioned her absence. Mrs.\\r\\nJennings was not struck by the same thought; for soon after his\\r\\nentrance, she walked across the room to the tea-table where Elinor\\r\\npresided, and whispered, \"The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see.\\r\\nHe knows nothing of it; do tell him, my dear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: \"_How fond he was of it!_\"]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her\\'s, and, with a look\\r\\nwhich perfectly assured her of his good information, inquired after\\r\\nher sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marianne is not well,\" said she. \"She has been indisposed all day,\\r\\nand we have persuaded her to go to bed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps, then,\" he hesitatingly replied, \"what I heard this morning\\r\\nmay be--there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at\\r\\nfirst.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did you hear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think--in short, that a man,\\r\\nwhom I _knew_ to be engaged--but how shall I tell you? If you know it\\r\\nalready, as surely you must, I may be spared.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean,\" answered Elinor, with forced calmness, \"Mr. Willoughby\\'s\\r\\nmarriage with Miss Grey. Yes, we _do_ know it all. This seems to have\\r\\nbeen a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first\\r\\nunfolded it to us. Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable! Where did you hear\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In a stationer\\'s shop in Pall Mall, where I had business. Two ladies\\r\\nwere waiting for their carriage, and one of them was giving the other\\r\\nan account of the intended match, in a voice so little attempting\\r\\nconcealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all. The name\\r\\nof Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught my\\r\\nattention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing\\r\\nwas now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey--it was\\r\\nno longer to be a secret--it would take place even within a few weeks,\\r\\nwith many particulars of preparations and other matters. One thing,\\r\\nespecially, I remember, because it served to identify the man still\\r\\nmore:--as soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to Combe\\r\\nMagna, his seat in Somersetshire. My astonishment!--but it would be\\r\\nimpossible to describe what I felt. The communicative lady I learnt,\\r\\non inquiry,--for I stayed in the shop till they were gone,--was a Mrs.\\r\\nEllison, and that, as I have been since informed, is the name of Miss\\r\\nGrey\\'s guardian.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is. But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand\\r\\npounds? In that, if in any thing, we may find an explanation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may be so; but Willoughby is capable--at least I think--\" He\\r\\nstopped a moment; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust\\r\\nitself, \"And your sister,--how did she,--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her sufferings have been very severe. I have only to hope that they\\r\\nmay be proportionately short. It has been, it is a most cruel\\r\\naffliction. Till yesterday, I believe, she never doubted his regard;\\r\\nand even now, perhaps--but _I_ am almost convinced that he never was\\r\\nreally attached to her. He has been very deceitful! and, in some\\r\\npoints, there seems a hardness of heart about him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said Colonel Brandon, \"there is, indeed! But your sister does\\r\\nnot--I think you said so--she does not consider quite as you do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly she would still\\r\\njustify him if she could.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal of the\\r\\ntea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties, the subject was\\r\\nnecessarily dropped. Mrs. Jennings, who had watched them with pleasure\\r\\nwhile they were talking, and who expected to see the effect of Miss\\r\\nDashwood\\'s communication, in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel\\r\\nBrandon\\'s side, as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of\\r\\nhope and happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole evening\\r\\nmore serious and thoughtful than usual.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom a night of more sleep than she had expected, Marianne awoke the\\r\\nnext morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had\\r\\nclosed her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt;\\r\\nand before breakfast was ready, they had gone through the subject\\r\\nagain and again; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate\\r\\ncounsel on Elinor\\'s side, the same impetuous feelings and varying\\r\\nopinions on Marianne\\'s, as before. Sometimes she could believe\\r\\nWilloughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself, and at\\r\\nothers, lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him.\\r\\nAt one moment she was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all\\r\\nthe world, at another she would seclude herself from it for ever, and\\r\\nat a third could resist it with energy. In one thing, however, she\\r\\nwas uniform, when it came to the point, in avoiding, where it was\\r\\npossible, the presence of Mrs. Jennings, and in a determined silence\\r\\nwhen obliged to endure it. Her heart was hardened against the belief\\r\\nof Mrs. Jennings\\'s entering into her sorrows with any compassion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, no, it cannot be,\" she cried; \"she cannot feel. Her kindness\\r\\nis not sympathy; her good-nature is not tenderness. All that she wants\\r\\nis gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her\\r\\nsister was often led in her opinion of others, by the irritable\\r\\nrefinement of her own mind, and the too great importance placed by her\\r\\non the delicacies of a strong sensibility, and the graces of a\\r\\npolished manner. Like half the rest of the world, if more than half\\r\\nthere be that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent abilities\\r\\nand an excellent disposition, was neither reasonable nor candid. She\\r\\nexpected from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own,\\r\\nand she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their\\r\\nactions on herself. Thus a circumstance occurred, while the sisters\\r\\nwere together in their own room after breakfast, which sunk the heart\\r\\nof Mrs. Jennings still lower in her estimation; because, through her\\r\\nown weakness, it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself,\\r\\nthough Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost\\r\\ngood-will.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance gaily smiling,\\r\\nfrom the persuasion of bringing comfort, she entered their room,\\r\\nsaying--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure will do you good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne heard enough. In one moment her imagination placed before her\\r\\na letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness and contrition,\\r\\nexplanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory, convincing; and\\r\\ninstantly followed by Willoughby himself, rushing eagerly into the\\r\\nroom to enforce, at her feet, by the eloquence of his eyes, the\\r\\nassurances of his letter. The work of one moment was destroyed by the\\r\\nnext. The hand writing of her mother, never till then unwelcome, was\\r\\nbefore her; and, in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed\\r\\nsuch an ecstasy of more than hope, she felt as if, till that instant,\\r\\nshe had never suffered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cruelty of Mrs. Jennings, no language, within her reach in her\\r\\nmoments of happiest eloquence, could have expressed; and now she could\\r\\nreproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with\\r\\npassionate violence;--a reproach, however, so entirely lost on its\\r\\nobject, that after many expressions of pity, she withdrew, still\\r\\nreferring her to the letter of comfort. But the letter, when she was\\r\\ncalm enough to read it, brought little comfort. Willoughby filled\\r\\nevery page. Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and\\r\\nrelying as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused by\\r\\nElinor\\'s application, to entreat from Marianne greater openness\\r\\ntowards them both; and this, with such tenderness towards her, such\\r\\naffection for Willoughby, and such a conviction of their future\\r\\nhappiness in each other, that she wept with agony through the whole of\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll her impatience to be at home again now returned; her mother was\\r\\ndearer to her than ever; dearer through the very excess of her\\r\\nmistaken confidence in Willoughby, and she was wildly urgent to be\\r\\ngone. Elinor, unable herself to determine whether it were better for\\r\\nMarianne to be in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own\\r\\nexcept of patience till their mother\\'s wishes could be known; and at\\r\\nlength she obtained her sister\\'s consent to wait for that knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she could not be easy\\r\\ntill the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as\\r\\nherself; and positively refusing Elinor\\'s offered attendance, went out\\r\\nalone for the rest of the morning. Elinor, with a very heavy heart,\\r\\naware of the pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving, by\\r\\nMarianne\\'s letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation\\r\\nfor it, then sat down to write her mother an account of what had\\r\\npassed, and entreat her directions for the future; while Marianne, who\\r\\ncame into the drawing-room on Mrs. Jennings\\'s going away, remained\\r\\nfixed at the table where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her\\r\\npen, grieving over her for the hardship of such a task, and grieving\\r\\nstill more fondly over its effect on her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour, when\\r\\nMarianne, whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise, was\\r\\nstartled by a rap at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who can this be?\" cried Elinor. \"So early too! I thought we _had_\\r\\nbeen safe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne moved to the window--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is Colonel Brandon!\" said she, with vexation. \"We are never safe\\r\\nfrom _him._\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not trust to _that_,\" retreating to her own room. \"A man who\\r\\nhas nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion\\r\\non that of others.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe event proved her conjecture right, though it was founded on\\r\\ninjustice and error; for Colonel Brandon _did_ come in; and Elinor,\\r\\nwho was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither,\\r\\nand who saw _that_ solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look,\\r\\nand in his anxious though brief inquiry after her, could not forgive\\r\\nher sister for esteeming him so lightly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street,\" said he, after the first\\r\\nsalutation, \"and she encouraged me to come on; and I was the more\\r\\neasily encouraged, because I thought it probable that I might find you\\r\\nalone, which I was very desirous of doing. My object--my wish--my sole\\r\\nwish in desiring it--I hope, I believe it is--is to be a means of\\r\\ngiving comfort;--no, I must not say comfort--not present comfort--but\\r\\nconviction, lasting conviction to your sister\\'s mind. My regard for\\r\\nher, for yourself, for your mother--will you allow me to prove it, by\\r\\nrelating some circumstances which nothing but a _very_ sincere\\r\\nregard--nothing but an earnest desire of being useful--I think I am\\r\\njustified--though where so many hours have been spent in convincing\\r\\nmyself that I am right, is there not some reason to fear I may be\\r\\nwrong?\" He stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I understand you,\" said Elinor. \"You have something to tell me of Mr.\\r\\nWilloughby, that will open his character farther. Your telling it will\\r\\nbe the greatest act of friendship that can be shown Marianne. _My_\\r\\ngratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to\\r\\nthat end, and _hers_ must be gained by it in time. Pray, pray let me\\r\\nhear it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton last October,--but\\r\\nthis will give you no idea--I must go farther back. You will find me a\\r\\nvery awkward narrator, Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin. A\\r\\nshort account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it _shall_\\r\\nbe a short one. On such a subject,\" sighing heavily, \"can I have\\r\\nlittle temptation to be diffuse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopt a moment for recollection, and then, with another sigh, went\\r\\non.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation--(it is not to be\\r\\nsupposed that it could make any impression on you)--a conversation\\r\\nbetween us one evening at Barton Park--it was the evening of a\\r\\ndance--in which I alluded to a lady I had once known, as resembling,\\r\\nin some measure, your sister Marianne.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed,\" answered Elinor, \"I have _not_ forgotten it.\" He looked\\r\\npleased by this remembrance, and added--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tender\\r\\nrecollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as well\\r\\nin mind as person. The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of\\r\\nfancy and spirits. This lady was one of my nearest relations, an\\r\\norphan from her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father. Our\\r\\nages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were\\r\\nplayfellows and friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not\\r\\nlove Eliza; and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as\\r\\nperhaps, judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you\\r\\nmight think me incapable of having ever felt. Her\\'s, for me, was, I\\r\\nbelieve, fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby\\r\\nand it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate. At\\r\\nseventeen she was lost to me for ever. She was married--married\\r\\nagainst her inclination to my brother. Her fortune was large, and our\\r\\nfamily estate much encumbered. And this, I fear, is all that can be\\r\\nsaid for the conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian.\\r\\nMy brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her. I had hoped\\r\\nthat her regard for me would support her under any difficulty, and for\\r\\nsome time it did; but at last the misery of her situation, for she\\r\\nexperienced great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though\\r\\nshe had promised me that nothing--but how blindly I relate! I have\\r\\nnever told you how this was brought on. We were within a few hours of\\r\\neloping together for Scotland. The treachery, or the folly, of my\\r\\ncousin\\'s maid betrayed us. I was banished to the house of a relation\\r\\nfar distant, and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,\\r\\ntill my father\\'s point was gained. I had depended on her fortitude too\\r\\nfar, and the blow was a severe one, but had her marriage been happy,\\r\\nso young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it,\\r\\nor at least I should not have now to lament it. This however was not\\r\\nthe case. My brother had no regard for her; his pleasures were not\\r\\nwhat they ought to have been, and from the first he treated her\\r\\nunkindly. The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so\\r\\ninexperienced as Mrs. Brandon\\'s, was but too natural. She resigned\\r\\nherself at first to all the misery of her situation; and happy had it\\r\\nbeen if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the\\r\\nremembrance of me occasioned. But can we wonder that, with such a\\r\\nhusband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or\\r\\nrestrain her (for my father lived only a few months after their\\r\\nmarriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she should\\r\\nfall? Had I remained in England, perhaps--but I meant to promote the\\r\\nhappiness of both by removing from her for years, and for that purpose\\r\\nhad procured my exchange. The shock which her marriage had given me,\"\\r\\nhe continued, in a voice of great agitation, \"was of trifling\\r\\nweight--was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two years\\r\\nafterwards, of her divorce. It was _that_ which threw this\\r\\ngloom,--even now the recollection of what I suffered--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few minutes\\r\\nabout the room. Elinor, affected by his relation, and still more by\\r\\nhis distress, could not speak. He saw her concern, and coming to her,\\r\\ntook her hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect. A few\\r\\nminutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned\\r\\nto England. My first care, when I _did_ arrive, was of course to seek\\r\\nfor her; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy. I could\\r\\nnot trace her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason to\\r\\nfear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of\\r\\nsin. Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune, nor\\r\\nsufficient for her comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my\\r\\nbrother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months\\r\\nbefore to another person. He imagined, and calmly could he imagine it,\\r\\nthat her extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her to\\r\\ndispose of it for some immediate relief. At last, however, and after I\\r\\nhad been six months in England, I _did_ find her. Regard for a former\\r\\nservant of my own, who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me\\r\\nto visit him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt; and\\r\\nthere, in the same house, under a similar confinement, was my\\r\\nunfortunate sister. So altered--so faded--worn down by acute suffering\\r\\nof every kind! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure\\r\\nbefore me, to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl,\\r\\non whom I had once doted. What I endured in so beholding her--but I\\r\\nhave no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it--I\\r\\nhave pained you too much already. That she was, to all appearance, in\\r\\nthe last stage of a consumption, was--yes, in such a situation it was\\r\\nmy greatest comfort. Life could do nothing for her, beyond giving time\\r\\nfor a better preparation for death; and that was given. I saw her\\r\\nplaced in comfortable lodgings, and under proper attendants; I visited\\r\\nher every day during the rest of her short life: I was with her in her\\r\\nlast moments.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor spoke her feelings in\\r\\nan exclamation of tender concern, at the fate of his unfortunate\\r\\nfriend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended,\" said he, \"by the\\r\\nresemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation.\\r\\nTheir fates, their fortunes, cannot be the same; and had the natural\\r\\nsweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a\\r\\nhappier marriage, she might have been all that you will live to see\\r\\nthe other be. But to what does all this lead? I seem to have been\\r\\ndistressing you for nothing. Ah! Miss Dashwood--a subject such as\\r\\nthis--untouched for fourteen years--it is dangerous to handle it at\\r\\nall! I _will_ be more collected--more concise. She left to my care her\\r\\nonly child, a little girl, the offspring of her first guilty\\r\\nconnection, who was then about three years old. She loved the child,\\r\\nand had always kept it with her. It was a valued, a precious trust to\\r\\nme; and gladly would I have discharged it in the strictest sense, by\\r\\nwatching over her education myself, had the nature of our situations\\r\\nallowed it; but I had no family, no home; and my little Eliza was\\r\\ntherefore placed at school. I saw her there whenever I could, and\\r\\nafter the death of my brother, (which happened about five years ago,\\r\\nand which left to me the possession of the family property,) she\\r\\nvisited me at Delaford. I called her a distant relation; but I am\\r\\nwell aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer\\r\\nconnection with her. It is now three years ago (she had just reached\\r\\nher fourteenth year,) that I removed her from school, to place her\\r\\nunder the care of a very respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire,\\r\\nwho had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time\\r\\nof life; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her\\r\\nsituation. But last February, almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly\\r\\ndisappeared. I had allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned\\r\\nout,) at her earnest desire, to go to Bath with one of her young\\r\\nfriends, who was attending her father there for his health. I knew him\\r\\nto be a very good sort of man, and I thought well of his\\r\\ndaughter--better than she deserved, for, with a most obstinate and\\r\\nill-judged secrecy, she would tell nothing, would give no clue, though\\r\\nshe certainly knew all. He, her father, a well-meaning, but not a\\r\\nquick-sighted man, could really, I believe, give no information; for\\r\\nhe had been generally confined to the house, while the girls were\\r\\nranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose; and he\\r\\ntried to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself, of\\r\\nhis daughter\\'s being entirely unconcerned in the business. In short, I\\r\\ncould learn nothing but that she was gone; all the rest, for eight\\r\\nlong months, was left to conjecture. What I thought, what I feared,\\r\\nmay be imagined; and what I suffered too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elinor, \"could it be--could Willoughby!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The first news that reached me of her,\" he continued, \"came in a\\r\\nletter from herself, last October. It was forwarded to me from\\r\\nDelaford, and I received it on the very morning of our intended party\\r\\nto Whitwell; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,\\r\\nwhich I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body,\\r\\nand which I believe gave offence to some. Little did Mr. Willoughby\\r\\nimagine, I suppose, when his looks censured me for incivility in\\r\\nbreaking up the party, that I was called away to the relief of one\\r\\nwhom he had made poor and miserable; but _had_ he known it, what would\\r\\nit have availed? Would he have been less gay or less happy in the\\r\\nsmiles of your sister? No, he had already done that, which no man who\\r\\n_can_ feel for another would do. He had left the girl whose youth and\\r\\ninnocence he had seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with\\r\\nno creditable home, no help, no friends, ignorant of his address! He\\r\\nhad left her, promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote, nor\\r\\nrelieved her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is beyond every thing!\" exclaimed Elinor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His character is now before you; expensive, dissipated, and worse\\r\\nthan both. Knowing all this, as I have now known it many weeks, guess\\r\\nwhat I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever,\\r\\nand on being assured that she was to marry him: guess what I must have\\r\\nfelt for all your sakes. When I came to you last week and found you\\r\\nalone, I came determined to know the truth; though irresolute what to\\r\\ndo when it _was_ known. My behaviour must have seemed strange to you\\r\\nthen; but now you will comprehend it. To suffer you all to be so\\r\\ndeceived; to see your sister--but what could I do? I had no hope of\\r\\ninterfering with success; and sometimes I thought your sister\\'s\\r\\ninfluence might yet reclaim him. But now, after such dishonorable\\r\\nusage, who can tell what were his designs on her. Whatever they may\\r\\nhave been, however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless _will_, turn\\r\\nwith gratitude towards her own condition, when she compares it with\\r\\nthat of my poor Eliza, when she considers the wretched and hopeless\\r\\nsituation of this poor girl, and pictures her to herself, with an\\r\\naffection for him so strong, still as strong as her own, and with a\\r\\nmind tormented by self-reproach, which must attend her through life.\\r\\nSurely this comparison must have its use with her. She will feel her\\r\\nown sufferings to be nothing. They proceed from no misconduct, and can\\r\\nbring no disgrace. On the contrary, every friend must be made still\\r\\nmore her friend by them. Concern for her unhappiness, and respect for\\r\\nher fortitude under it, must strengthen every attachment. Use your own\\r\\ndiscretion, however, in communicating to her what I have told you. You\\r\\nmust know best what will be its effect; but had I not seriously, and\\r\\nfrom my heart believed it might be of service, might lessen her\\r\\nregrets, I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this\\r\\naccount of my family afflictions, with a recital which may seem to\\r\\nhave been intended to raise myself at the expense of others.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor\\'s thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness;\\r\\nattended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage\\r\\nto Marianne, from the communication of what had passed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been more pained,\" said she, \"by her endeavors to acquit him\\r\\nthan by all the rest; for it irritates her mind more than the most\\r\\nperfect conviction of his unworthiness can do. Now, though at first\\r\\nshe will suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier. Have\\r\\nyou,\" she continued, after a short silence, \"ever seen Mr. Willoughby\\r\\nsince you left him at Barton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" he replied gravely, \"once I have. One meeting was unavoidable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor, startled by his manner, looked at him anxiously, saying--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What? have you met him to--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I could meet him no other way. Eliza had confessed to me, though most\\r\\nreluctantly, the name of her lover; and when he returned to town,\\r\\nwhich was within a fortnight after myself, we met by appointment, he\\r\\nto defend, I to punish his conduct. We returned unwounded, and the\\r\\nmeeting, therefore, never got abroad.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this; but to a man and a\\r\\nsoldier she presumed not to censure it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Such,\" said Colonel Brandon, after a pause, \"has been the unhappy\\r\\nresemblance between the fate of mother and daughter! and so\\r\\nimperfectly have I discharged my trust!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is she still in town?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; as soon as she recovered from her lying-in, for I found her near\\r\\nher delivery, I removed her and her child into the country, and there\\r\\nshe remains.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRecollecting, soon afterwards, that he was probably dividing Elinor\\r\\nfrom her sister, he put an end to his visit, receiving from her again\\r\\nthe same grateful acknowledgments, and leaving her full of compassion\\r\\nand esteem for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss\\r\\nDashwood to her sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her was\\r\\nnot entirely such as the former had hoped to see. Not that Marianne\\r\\nappeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she listened to\\r\\nit all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither\\r\\nobjection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and\\r\\nseemed to show by her tears that she felt it to be impossible. But\\r\\nthough this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt\\r\\n_was_ carried home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the\\r\\neffect of it, in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he\\r\\ncalled, in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking, with a kind\\r\\nof compassionate respect, and though she saw her spirits less\\r\\nviolently irritated than before, she did not see her less wretched.\\r\\nHer mind did become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.\\r\\nShe felt the loss of Willoughby\\'s character yet more heavily than she\\r\\nhad felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss\\r\\nWilliams, the misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his\\r\\ndesigns might _once_ have been on herself, preyed altogether so much\\r\\non her spirits, that she could not bring herself to speak of what she\\r\\nfelt even to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave\\r\\nmore pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most\\r\\nopen and most frequent confession of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and\\r\\nanswering Elinor\\'s letter would be only to give a repetition of what\\r\\nher daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly\\r\\nless painful than Marianne\\'s, and an indignation even greater than\\r\\nElinor\\'s. Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,\\r\\narrived to tell all that she suffered and thought; to express her\\r\\nanxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat she would bear up with\\r\\nfortitude under this misfortune. Bad indeed must the nature of\\r\\nMarianne\\'s affliction be, when her mother could talk of fortitude!\\r\\nmortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets, which\\r\\n_she_ could wish her not to indulge!\\r\\n\\r\\nAgainst the interest of her own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had\\r\\ndetermined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where, at\\r\\nthat time, than at Barton, where every thing within her view would be\\r\\nbringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, by\\r\\nconstantly placing Willoughby before her, such as she had always seen\\r\\nhim there. She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by all\\r\\nmeans not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of\\r\\nwhich, though never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to\\r\\ncomprise at least five or six weeks. A variety of occupations, of\\r\\nobjects, and of company, which could not be procured at Barton, would\\r\\nbe inevitable there, and might yet, she hoped, cheat Marianne, at\\r\\ntimes, into some interest beyond herself, and even into some\\r\\namusement, much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom all danger of seeing Willoughby again, her mother considered her\\r\\nto be at least equally safe in town as in the country, since his\\r\\nacquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her\\r\\nfriends. Design could never bring them in each other\\'s way: negligence\\r\\ncould never leave them exposed to a surprise; and chance had less in\\r\\nits favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of\\r\\nBarton, where it might force him before her while paying that visit at\\r\\nAllenham on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at\\r\\nfirst as a probable event, had brought herself to expect as a certain\\r\\none.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where\\r\\nthey were; a letter from her son-in-law had told her that he and his\\r\\nwife were to be in town before the middle of February, and she judged\\r\\nit right that they should sometimes see their brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne had promised to be guided by her mother\\'s opinion, and she\\r\\nsubmitted to it therefore without opposition, though it proved\\r\\nperfectly different from what she wished and expected, though she felt\\r\\nit to be entirely wrong, formed on mistaken grounds, and that by\\r\\nrequiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only\\r\\npossible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal sympathy of her\\r\\nmother, and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent\\r\\nher ever knowing a moment\\'s rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was a matter of great consolation to her, that what brought\\r\\nevil to herself would bring good to her sister; and Elinor, on the\\r\\nother hand, suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid\\r\\nEdward entirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their\\r\\nlonger stay would therefore militate against her own happiness, it\\r\\nwould be better for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby\\'s\\r\\nname mentioned, was not thrown away. Marianne, though without knowing\\r\\nit herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor\\r\\nSir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.\\r\\nElinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards\\r\\nherself, but that was impossible, and she was obliged to listen day\\r\\nafter day to the indignation of them all.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir John, could not have thought it possible. \"A man of whom he had\\r\\nalways had such reason to think well! Such a good-natured fellow! He\\r\\ndid not believe there was a bolder rider in England! It was an\\r\\nunaccountable business. He wished him at the devil with all his heart.\\r\\nHe would not speak another word to him, meet him where he might, for\\r\\nall the world! No, not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert,\\r\\nand they were kept watching for two hours together. Such a scoundrel\\r\\nof a fellow! such a deceitful dog! It was only the last time they met\\r\\nthat he had offered him one of Folly\\'s puppies! and this was the end\\r\\nof it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally angry. \"She was determined to\\r\\ndrop his acquaintance immediately, and she was very thankful that she\\r\\nhad never been acquainted with him at all. She wished with all her\\r\\nheart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify,\\r\\nfor it was a great deal too far off to visit; she hated him so much\\r\\nthat she was resolved never to mention his name again, and she should\\r\\ntell everybody she saw, how good-for-nothing he was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of Mrs. Palmer\\'s sympathy was shown in procuring all the\\r\\nparticulars in her power of the approaching marriage, and\\r\\ncommunicating them to Elinor. She could soon tell at what coachmaker\\'s\\r\\nthe new carriage was building, by what painter Mr. Willoughby\\'s\\r\\nportrait was drawn, and at what warehouse Miss Grey\\'s clothes might be\\r\\nseen.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Offered him one of Folly\\'s puppies._]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a\\r\\nhappy relief to Elinor\\'s spirits, oppressed as they often were by\\r\\nthe clamorous kindness of the others. It was a great comfort to her to\\r\\nbe sure of exciting no interest in _one_ person at least among their\\r\\ncircle of friends: a great comfort to know that there was _one_ who\\r\\nwould meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any\\r\\nanxiety for her sister\\'s health.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery qualification is raised at times, by the circumstances of the\\r\\nmoment, to more than its real value; and she was sometimes worried\\r\\ndown by officious condolence to rate good-breeding as more\\r\\nindispensable to comfort than good-nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day,\\r\\nor twice, if the subject occurred very often, by saying, \"It is very\\r\\nshocking, indeed!\" and by the means of this continual though gentle\\r\\nvent, was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first\\r\\nwithout the smallest emotion, but very soon to see them without\\r\\nrecollecting a word of the matter; and having thus supported the\\r\\ndignity of her own sex, and spoken her decided censure of what was\\r\\nwrong in the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend to the\\r\\ninterest of her own assemblies, and therefore determined (though\\r\\nrather against the opinion of Sir John) that as Mrs. Willoughby would\\r\\nat once be a woman of elegance and fortune, to leave her card with her\\r\\nas soon as she married.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Brandon\\'s delicate, unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome\\r\\nto Miss Dashwood. He had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate\\r\\ndiscussion of her sister\\'s disappointment, by the friendly zeal with\\r\\nwhich he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with\\r\\nconfidence. His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing\\r\\npast sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye\\r\\nwith which Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness of her\\r\\nvoice whenever (though it did not often happen) she was obliged, or\\r\\ncould oblige herself to speak to him. _These_ assured him that his\\r\\nexertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, and\\r\\n_these_ gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter;\\r\\nbut Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that\\r\\nthe Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that she could neither\\r\\nprevail on him to make the offer himself, nor commission her to make\\r\\nit for him, began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead of\\r\\nMid-summer, they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the end\\r\\nof a week that it would not be a match at all. The good understanding\\r\\nbetween the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that\\r\\nthe honours of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour, would\\r\\nall be made over to _her_; and Mrs. Jennings had, for some time ceased\\r\\nto think at all of Mrs. Ferrars.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in February, within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby\\'s\\r\\nletter, Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he\\r\\nwas married. She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to\\r\\nherself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over, as she\\r\\nwas desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it\\r\\nfrom the public papers, which she saw her eagerly examining every\\r\\nmorning.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe received the news with resolute composure; made no observation on\\r\\nit, and at first shed no tears; but after a short time they would\\r\\nburst out, and for the rest of the day, she was in a state hardly less\\r\\npitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married; and Elinor now\\r\\nhoped, as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them, to\\r\\nprevail on her sister, who had never yet left the house since the blow\\r\\nfirst fell, to go out again by degrees as she had done before.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout this time the two Miss Steeles, lately arrived at their cousin\\'s\\r\\nhouse in Bartlett\\'s Buildings, Holborn, presented themselves again\\r\\nbefore their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets; and\\r\\nwere welcomed by them all with great cordiality.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor only was sorry to see them. Their presence always gave her\\r\\npain, and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the\\r\\noverpowering delight of Lucy in finding her _still_ in town.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here\\r\\n_still_,\" said she repeatedly, with a strong emphasis on the word.\\r\\n\"But I always thought I _should_ I was almost sure you would not leave\\r\\nLondon yet awhile; though you _told_ me, you know, at Barton, that you\\r\\nshould not stay above a _month._ But I thought, at the time, that you\\r\\nwould most likely change your mind when it came to the point. It would\\r\\nhave been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and\\r\\nsister came. And now to be sure you will be in no _hurry_ to be gone.\\r\\nI am amazingly glad you did not keep to _your word._\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor perfectly understood her, and was forced to use all her\\r\\nself-command to make it appear that she did _not._\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"and how did you travel?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not in the stage, I assure you,\" replied Miss Steele, with quick\\r\\nexultation; \"we came post all the way, and had a very smart beau to\\r\\nattend us. Dr. Davies was coming to town, and so we thought we\\'d join\\r\\nhim in a post-chaise; and he behaved very genteelly, and paid ten or\\r\\ntwelve shillings more than we did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, oh!\" cried Mrs. Jennings; \"very pretty, indeed! and the Doctor is\\r\\na single man, I warrant you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There now,\" said Miss Steele, affectedly simpering, \"everybody laughs\\r\\nat me so about the Doctor, and I cannot think why. My cousins say they\\r\\nare sure I have made a conquest; but for my part I declare I never\\r\\nthink about him from one hour\\'s end to another. \\'Lord! here comes your\\r\\nbeau, Nancy,\\' my cousin said t\\'other day, when she saw him crossing\\r\\nthe street to the house. My beau, indeed! said I--I cannot think who\\r\\nyou mean. The Doctor is no beau of mine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, that is very pretty talking--but it won\\'t do--the Doctor is\\r\\nthe man, I see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed!\" replied her cousin, with affected earnestness, \"and I\\r\\nbeg you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that she\\r\\ncertainly would _not_, and Miss Steele was made completely happy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister, Miss\\r\\nDashwood, when they come to town,\" said Lucy, returning, after a\\r\\ncessation of hostile hints, to the charge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I do not think we shall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, I dare say you will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor would not humour her by farther opposition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for\\r\\nso long a time together!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Long a time, indeed!\" interposed Mrs. Jennings. \"Why, their visit is\\r\\nbut just begun!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _A very smart beau._]\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy was silenced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss Dashwood,\" said Miss\\r\\nSteele. \"I am sorry she is not well--\" for Marianne had left the room\\r\\non their arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very good. My sister will be equally sorry to miss the\\r\\npleasure of seeing you; but she has been very much plagued lately with\\r\\nnervous head-aches, which make her unfit for company or conversation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old friends as Lucy and\\r\\nme!--I think she might see _us_; and I am sure we would not speak a\\r\\nword.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor, with great civility, declined the proposal. Her sister was\\r\\nperhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her dressing gown, and therefore\\r\\nnot able to come to them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, if that\\'s all,\" cried Miss Steele, \"we can just as well go and\\r\\nsee _her._\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper; but\\r\\nshe was saved the trouble of checking it, by Lucy\\'s sharp reprimand,\\r\\nwhich now, as on many occasions, though it did not give much sweetness\\r\\nto the manners of one sister, was of advantage in governing those of\\r\\nthe other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some opposition, Marianne yielded to her sister\\'s entreaties,\\r\\nand consented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for\\r\\nhalf an hour. She expressly conditioned, however, for paying no\\r\\nvisits, and would do no more than accompany them to Gray\\'s in\\r\\nSackville Street, where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the\\r\\nexchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there\\r\\nwas a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call;\\r\\nand as she had no business at Gray\\'s, it was resolved, that while her\\r\\nyoung friends transacted their\\'s, she should pay her visit and return\\r\\nfor them.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found so many people\\r\\nbefore them in the room, that there was not a person at liberty to\\r\\ntend to their orders; and they were obliged to wait. All that could be\\r\\ndone was, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to\\r\\npromise the quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing\\r\\nthere, and it is probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting\\r\\nhis politeness to a quicker despatch. But the correctness of his eye,\\r\\nand the delicacy of his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness. He\\r\\nwas giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself, and till its size,\\r\\nshape, and ornaments were determined, all of which, after examining\\r\\nand debating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the\\r\\nshop, were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had no\\r\\nleisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies, than what was\\r\\ncomprised in three or four very broad stares; a kind of notice which\\r\\nserved to imprint on Elinor the remembrance of a person and face, of\\r\\nstrong, natural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in the first\\r\\nstyle of fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and\\r\\nresentment, on this impertinent examination of their features, and on\\r\\nthe puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of\\r\\nthe different toothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by\\r\\nremaining unconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect\\r\\nher thoughts within herself, and be as ignorant of what was passing\\r\\naround her, in Mr. Gray\\'s shop, as in her own bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the affair was decided. The ivory, the gold, and the pearls,\\r\\nall received their appointment, and the gentleman having named the\\r\\nlast day on which his existence could be continued without the\\r\\npossession of the toothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely\\r\\ncare, and bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such a\\r\\none as seemed rather to demand than express admiration, walked off\\r\\nwith a happy air of real conceit and affected indifference.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor lost no time in bringing her business forward, was on the point\\r\\nof concluding it, when another gentleman presented himself at her\\r\\nside. She turned her eyes towards his face, and found him with some\\r\\nsurprise to be her brother.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Introduced to Mrs. Jennings._]\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very\\r\\ncreditable appearance in Mr. Gray\\'s shop. John Dashwood was really far\\r\\nfrom being sorry to see his sisters again; it rather gave them\\r\\nsatisfaction; and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and\\r\\nattentive.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wished very much to call upon you yesterday,\" said he, \"but it was\\r\\nimpossible, for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts\\r\\nat Exeter Exchange; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs.\\r\\nFerrars. Harry was vastly pleased. _This_ morning I had fully intended\\r\\nto call on you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one\\r\\nhas always so much to do on first coming to town. I am come here to\\r\\nbespeak Fanny a seal. But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able\\r\\nto call in Berkeley Street, and be introduced to your friend Mrs.\\r\\nJennings. I understand she is a woman of very good fortune. And the\\r\\nMiddletons too, you must introduce me to _them_. As my mother-in-law\\'s\\r\\nrelations, I shall be happy to show them every respect. They are\\r\\nexcellent neighbours to you in the country, I understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excellent indeed. Their attention to our comfort, their friendliness\\r\\nin every particular, is more than I can express.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word; extremely glad indeed.\\r\\nBut so it ought to be; they are people of large fortune, they are\\r\\nrelated to you, and every civility and accommodation that can serve to\\r\\nmake your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected. And so you\\r\\nare most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for\\r\\nnothing! Edward brought us a most charming account of the place: the\\r\\nmost complete thing of its kind, he said, that ever was, and you all\\r\\nseemed to enjoy it beyond any thing. It was a great satisfaction to us\\r\\nto hear it, I assure you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother; and was not sorry to\\r\\nbe spared the necessity of answering him, by the arrival of Mrs.\\r\\nJennings\\'s servant, who came to tell her that his mistress waited for\\r\\nthem at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, was introduced to Mrs.\\r\\nJennings at the door of her carriage, and repeating his hope of being\\r\\nable to call on them the next day, took leave.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Mrs. Jennings assured him directly that she should not\\r\\nstand upon ceremony._]\\r\\n\\r\\nHis visit was duly paid. He came with a pretence at an apology from\\r\\ntheir sister-in-law, for not coming too; \"but she was so much engaged\\r\\nwith her mother, that really she had no leisure for going any where.\"\\r\\nMrs. Jennings, however, assured him directly, that she should not\\r\\nstand upon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something like\\r\\nit, and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and\\r\\nbring her sisters to see her. His manners to _them_, though calm, were\\r\\nperfectly kind; to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on\\r\\nColonel Brandon\\'s coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a\\r\\ncuriosity which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know him to be\\r\\nrich, to be equally civil to _him._\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter staying with them half an hour, he asked Elinor to walk with him\\r\\nto Conduit Street, and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.\\r\\nThe weather was remarkably fine, and she readily consented. As soon as\\r\\nthey were out of the house, his enquiries began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is Colonel Brandon? Is he a man of fortune?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; he has very good property in Dorsetshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad of it. He seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think,\\r\\nElinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable\\r\\nestablishment in life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Me, brother! what do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He likes you. I observed him narrowly, and am convinced of it. What\\r\\nis the amount of his fortune?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe about two thousand a year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two thousand a-year;\" and then working himself up to a pitch of\\r\\nenthusiastic generosity, he added, \"Elinor, I wish with all my heart\\r\\nit were _twice_ as much, for your sake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I believe you,\" replied Elinor; \"but I am very sure that\\r\\nColonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying _me._\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken. A very little\\r\\ntrouble on your side secures him. Perhaps just at present he may be\\r\\nundecided; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back; his\\r\\nfriends may all advise him against it. But some of those little\\r\\nattentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix\\r\\nhim, in spite of himself. And there can be no reason why you should\\r\\nnot try for him. It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on\\r\\nyour side--in short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is\\r\\nquite out of the question, the objections are insurmountable--you have\\r\\ntoo much sense not to see all that. Colonel Brandon must be the man;\\r\\nand no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with\\r\\nyou and your family. It is a match that must give universal\\r\\nsatisfaction. In short, it is a kind of thing that,\" lowering his\\r\\nvoice to an important whisper, \"will be exceedingly welcome to _all\\r\\nparties._\" Recollecting himself, however, he added, \"That is, I mean\\r\\nto say--your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled;\\r\\nFanny particularly, for she has your interest very much at heart, I\\r\\nassure you. And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured\\r\\nwoman, I am sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much\\r\\nthe other day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor would not vouchsafe any answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would be something remarkable, now,\" he continued, \"something\\r\\ndroll, if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the\\r\\nsame time. And yet it is not very unlikely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is Mr. Edward Ferrars,\" said Elinor, with resolution, \"going to be\\r\\nmarried?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is not actually settled, but there is such a thing in agitation.\\r\\nHe has a most excellent mother. Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost\\r\\nliberality, will come forward, and settle on him a thousand a year, if\\r\\nthe match takes place. The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter\\r\\nof the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds. A very desirable\\r\\nconnection on both sides, and I have not a doubt of its taking place\\r\\nin time. A thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away,\\r\\nto make over for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit. To give\\r\\nyou another instance of her liberality:--The other day, as soon as we\\r\\ncame to town, aware that money could not be very plenty with us just\\r\\nnow, she put bank-notes into Fanny\\'s hands to the amount of two\\r\\nhundred pounds. And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a\\r\\ngreat expense while we are here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused for her assent and compassion; and she forced herself to\\r\\nsay--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be\\r\\nconsiderable; but your income is a large one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose. I do not mean to\\r\\ncomplain, however; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one, and I hope\\r\\nwill in time be better. The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying\\r\\non, is a most serious drain. And then I have made a little purchase\\r\\nwithin this half year; East Kingham Farm, you must remember the place,\\r\\nwhere old Gibson used to live. The land was so very desirable for me\\r\\nin every respect, so immediately adjoining my own property, that I\\r\\nfelt it my duty to buy it. I could not have answered it to my\\r\\nconscience to let it fall into any other hands. A man must pay for his\\r\\nconvenience; and it _has_ cost me a vast deal of money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"More than you think it really and intrinsically worth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I hope not that. I might have sold it again, the next day, for\\r\\nmore than I gave: but, with regard to the purchase-money, I might have\\r\\nbeen very unfortunate indeed; for the stocks were at that time so low,\\r\\nthat if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker\\'s\\r\\nhands, I must have sold out to very great loss.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor could only smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming\\r\\nto Norland. Our respected father, as you well know, bequeathed all the\\r\\nStanhill effects that remained at Norland (and very valuable they\\r\\nwere) to your mother. Far be it from me to repine at his doing so; he\\r\\nhad an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose,\\r\\nbut, in consequence of it, we have been obliged to make large\\r\\npurchases of linen, china, &c. to supply the place of what was taken\\r\\naway. You may guess, after all these expenses, how very far we must be\\r\\nfrom being rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars\\'s kindness is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" said Elinor; \"and assisted by her liberality, I hope you\\r\\nmay yet live to be in easy circumstances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Another year or two may do much towards it,\" he gravely replied; \"but\\r\\nhowever there is still a great deal to be done. There is not a stone\\r\\nlaid of Fanny\\'s green-house, and nothing but the plan of the\\r\\nflower-garden marked out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is the green-house to be?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon the knoll behind the house. The old walnut trees are all come\\r\\ndown to make room for it. It will be a very fine object from many\\r\\nparts of the park, and the flower-garden will slope down just before\\r\\nit, and be exceedingly pretty. We have cleared away all the old thorns\\r\\nthat grew in patches over the brow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor kept her concern and her censure to herself; and was very\\r\\nthankful that Marianne was not present, to share the provocation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving now said enough to make his poverty clear, and to do away the\\r\\nnecessity of buying a pair of ear-rings for each of his sisters, in\\r\\nhis next visit at Gray\\'s his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he\\r\\nbegan to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She seems a most valuable woman indeed--Her house, her style of\\r\\nliving, all bespeak an exceeding good income; and it is an\\r\\nacquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto, but\\r\\nin the end may prove materially advantageous. Her inviting you to town\\r\\nis certainly a vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it speaks\\r\\naltogether so great a regard for you, that in all probability when she\\r\\ndies you will not be forgotten. She must have a great deal to leave.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she has only her\\r\\njointure, which will descend to her children.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income. Few\\r\\npeople of common prudence will do _that_; and whatever she saves, she\\r\\nwill be able to dispose of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her\\r\\ndaughters, than to us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her daughters are both exceedingly well married, and therefore I\\r\\ncannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther.\\r\\nWhereas, in my opinion, by her taking so much notice of you, and\\r\\ntreating you in this kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on\\r\\nher future consideration, which a conscientious woman would not\\r\\ndisregard. Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour; and she can\\r\\nhardly do all this, without being aware of the expectation it raises.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But she raises none in those most concerned. Indeed, brother, your\\r\\nanxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, to be sure,\" said he, seeming to recollect himself, \"people have\\r\\nlittle, have very little in their power. But, my dear Elinor, what is\\r\\nthe matter with Marianne?--she looks very unwell, has lost her colour,\\r\\nand is grown quite thin. Is she ill?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint on her for several\\r\\nweeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry for that. At her time of life, any thing of an illness\\r\\ndestroys the bloom for ever! Her\\'s has been a very short one! She was\\r\\nas handsome a girl last September, as I ever saw; and as likely to\\r\\nattract the man. There was something in her style of beauty, to\\r\\nplease them particularly. I remember Fanny used to say that she would\\r\\nmarry sooner and better than you did; not but what she is exceedingly\\r\\nfond of _you_, but so it happened to strike her. She will be mistaken,\\r\\nhowever. I question whether Marianne _now_, will marry a man worth\\r\\nmore than five or six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very\\r\\nmuch deceived if _you_ do not do better. Dorsetshire! I know very\\r\\nlittle of Dorsetshire; but, my dear Elinor, I shall be exceedingly\\r\\nglad to know more of it; and I think I can answer for your having\\r\\nFanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your\\r\\nvisitors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no\\r\\nlikelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectation\\r\\nof too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he was really\\r\\nresolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the\\r\\nmarriage by every possible attention. He had just compunction enough\\r\\nfor having done nothing for his sisters himself, to be exceedingly\\r\\nanxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer from\\r\\nColonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means\\r\\nof atoning for his own neglect.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir John\\r\\ncame in before their visit ended. Abundance of civilities passed on\\r\\nall sides. Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood\\r\\ndid not seem to know much about horses, he soon set him down as a very\\r\\ngood-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his\\r\\nappearance to think his acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood\\r\\nwent away delighted with both.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny,\" said he, as he\\r\\nwalked back with his sister. \"Lady Middleton is really a most elegant\\r\\nwoman! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know. And Mrs.\\r\\nJennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman, though not so elegant\\r\\nas her daughter. Your sister need not have any scruple even of\\r\\nvisiting _her_, which, to say the truth, has been a little the case,\\r\\nand very naturally; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow\\r\\nof a man who had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and Mrs.\\r\\nFerrars were both strongly prepossessed, that neither she nor her\\r\\ndaughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate\\r\\nwith. But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband\\'s judgment,\\r\\nthat she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her\\r\\ndaughter; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former,\\r\\neven the woman with whom her sisters were staying, by no means\\r\\nunworthy her notice; and as for Lady Middleton, she found her one of\\r\\nthe most charming women in the world!\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood. There was a\\r\\nkind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually\\r\\nattracted them; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid\\r\\npropriety of demeanor, and a general want of understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the\\r\\ngood opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs.\\r\\nJennings, and to _her_ she appeared nothing more than a little\\r\\nproud-looking woman of uncordial address, who met her husband\\'s\\r\\nsisters without any affection, and almost without having anything to\\r\\nsay to them; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley\\r\\nStreet, she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor wanted very much to know, though she did not choose to ask,\\r\\nwhether Edward was then in town; but nothing would have induced Fanny\\r\\nvoluntarily to mention his name before her, till able to tell her that\\r\\nhis marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on, or till her husband\\'s\\r\\nexpectations on Colonel Brandon were answered; because she believed\\r\\nthem still so very much attached to each other, that they could not be\\r\\ntoo sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion. The\\r\\nintelligence however, which _she_ would not give, soon flowed from\\r\\nanother quarter. Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor\\'s compassion\\r\\non being unable to see Edward, though he had arrived in town with Mr.\\r\\nand Mrs. Dashwood. He dared not come to Bartlett\\'s Buildings for fear\\r\\nof detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet, was not to\\r\\nbe told, they could do nothing at present but write.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward assured them himself of his being in town, within a very short\\r\\ntime, by twice calling in Berkeley Street. Twice was his card found on\\r\\nthe table, when they returned from their morning\\'s engagements. Elinor\\r\\nwas pleased that he had called; and still more pleased that she had\\r\\nmissed him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons,\\r\\nthat, though not much in the habit of giving anything, they determined\\r\\nto give them--a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began,\\r\\ninvited them to dine in Harley Street, where they had taken a very\\r\\ngood house for three months. Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were\\r\\ninvited likewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel\\r\\nBrandon, who, always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were,\\r\\nreceived his eager civilities with some surprise, but much more\\r\\npleasure. They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn\\r\\nwhether her sons were to be of the party. The expectation of seeing\\r\\n_her_, however, was enough to make her interested in the engagement;\\r\\nfor though she could now meet Edward\\'s mother without that strong\\r\\nanxiety which had once promised to attend such an introduction, though\\r\\nshe could now see her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of\\r\\nherself, her desire of being in company with Mrs. Ferrars, her\\r\\ncuriosity to know what she was like, was as lively as ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interest with which she thus anticipated the party, was soon\\r\\nafterwards increased, more powerfully than pleasantly, by her hearing\\r\\nthat the Miss Steeles were also to be at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton, so\\r\\nagreeable had their assiduities made them to her, that though Lucy was\\r\\ncertainly not so elegant, and her sister not even genteel, she was as\\r\\nready as Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit\\r\\nStreet; and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss\\r\\nSteeles, as soon as the Dashwoods\\' invitation was known, that their\\r\\nvisit should begin a few days before the party took place.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, as the nieces of\\r\\nthe gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother,\\r\\nmight not have done much, however, towards procuring them seats at her\\r\\ntable; but as Lady Middleton\\'s guests they must be welcome; and Lucy,\\r\\nwho had long wanted to be personally known to the family, to have a\\r\\nnearer view of their characters and her own difficulties, and to have\\r\\nan opportunity of endeavouring to please them, had seldom been happier\\r\\nin her life, than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood\\'s card.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Elinor its effect was very different. She began immediately to\\r\\ndetermine, that Edward who lived with his mother, must be asked as his\\r\\nmother was, to a party given by his sister; and to see him for the\\r\\nfirst time, after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!--she hardly\\r\\nknew how she could bear it!\\r\\n\\r\\nThese apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded entirely on reason, and\\r\\ncertainly not at all on truth. They were relieved however, not by her\\r\\nown recollection, but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself\\r\\nto be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward\\r\\ncertainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped to\\r\\nbe carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept\\r\\naway by the extreme affection for herself, which he could not conceal\\r\\nwhen they were together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies\\r\\nto this formidable mother-in-law.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!\" said Lucy, as they walked up the stairs\\r\\ntogether--for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings,\\r\\nthat they all followed the servant at the same time--\"There is nobody\\r\\nhere but you, that can feel for me. I declare I can hardly stand. Good\\r\\ngracious!--In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness\\r\\ndepends on--that is to be my mother!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the\\r\\npossibility of its being Miss Morton\\'s mother, rather than her own,\\r\\nwhom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that, she assured\\r\\nher, and with great sincerity, that she did pity her--to the utter\\r\\namazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at\\r\\nleast to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright, even to formality, in\\r\\nher figure, and serious, even to sourness, in her aspect. Her\\r\\ncomplexion was sallow; and her features small, without beauty, and\\r\\nnaturally without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow had\\r\\nrescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity, by giving it\\r\\nthe strong characters of pride and ill nature. She was not a woman of\\r\\nmany words; for, unlike people in general, she proportioned them to\\r\\nthe number of her ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her,\\r\\nnot one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed with the\\r\\nspirited determination of disliking her at all events.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor could not _now_ be made unhappy by this behaviour. A few months\\r\\nago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it was not in Mrs.\\r\\nFerrars\\' power to distress her by it now; and the difference of her\\r\\nmanners to the Miss Steeles, a difference which seemed purposely made\\r\\nto humble her more, only amused her. She could not but smile to see\\r\\nthe graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very\\r\\nperson--for Lucy was particularly distinguished--whom of all others,\\r\\nhad they known as much as she did, they would have been most anxious\\r\\nto mortify; while she herself, who had comparatively no power to wound\\r\\nthem, sat pointedly slighted by both. But while she smiled at a\\r\\ngraciousness so misapplied, she could not reflect on the mean-spirited\\r\\nfolly from which it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions with\\r\\nwhich the Miss Steeles courted its continuance, without thoroughly\\r\\ndespising them all four.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished; and Miss\\r\\nSteele wanted only to be teased about Dr. Davies to be perfectly\\r\\nhappy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous, and every\\r\\nthing bespoke the Mistress\\'s inclination for show, and the Master\\'s\\r\\nability to support it. In spite of the improvements and additions\\r\\nwhich were making to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner\\r\\nhaving once been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell\\r\\nout at a loss, nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had\\r\\ntried to infer from it; no poverty of any kind, except of\\r\\nconversation, appeared; but there, the deficiency was considerable.\\r\\nJohn Dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing,\\r\\nand his wife had still less. But there was no peculiar disgrace in\\r\\nthis; for it was very much the case with the chief of their visitors,\\r\\nwho almost all laboured under one or other of these disqualifications\\r\\nfor being agreeable--Want of sense, either natural or improved--want\\r\\nof elegance--want of spirits--or want of temper.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner, this\\r\\npoverty was particularly evident, for the gentlemen _had_ supplied the\\r\\ndiscourse with some variety--the variety of politics, inclosing land,\\r\\nand breaking horses--but then it was all over; and one subject only\\r\\nengaged the ladies till coffee came in, which was the comparative\\r\\nheights of Harry Dashwood, and Lady Middleton\\'s second son William,\\r\\nwho were nearly of the same age.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad both the children been there, the affair might have been\\r\\ndetermined too easily by measuring them at once; but as Harry only was\\r\\npresent, it was all conjectural assertion on both sides; and every\\r\\nbody had a right to be equally positive in their opinion, and to\\r\\nrepeat it over and over again as often as they liked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parties stood thus:--\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two mothers, though each really convinced that her own son was the\\r\\ntallest, politely decided in favour of the other. The two\\r\\ngrandmothers, with not less partiality, but more sincerity, were\\r\\nequally earnest in support of their own descendant.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other,\\r\\nthought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age, and could\\r\\nnot conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world\\r\\nbetween them; and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it, as\\r\\nfast as she could, in favour of each.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor, having once delivered her opinion on William\\'s side, by which\\r\\nshe offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, did not see the\\r\\nnecessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when\\r\\ncalled on for her\\'s, offended them all, by declaring that she had no\\r\\nopinion to give, as she had never thought about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty\\r\\npair of screens for her sister-in-law, which being now just mounted\\r\\nand brought home, ornamented her present drawing room; and these\\r\\nscreens, catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following the other\\r\\ngentlemen into the room, were officiously handed by him to Colonel\\r\\nBrandon for his admiration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These are done by my eldest sister,\" said he; \"and you, as a man of\\r\\ntaste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them. I do not know whether\\r\\nyou have ever happened to see any of her performances before, but she\\r\\nis in general reckoned to draw extremely well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship,\\r\\nwarmly admired the screens, as he would have done any thing painted by\\r\\nMiss Dashwood; and on the curiosity of the others being of course\\r\\nexcited, they were handed round for general inspection. Mrs. Ferrars,\\r\\nnot aware of their being Elinor\\'s work, particularly requested to look\\r\\nat them; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady\\r\\nMiddleton\\'s approbation, Fanny presented them to her mother,\\r\\nconsiderately informing her, at the same time, that they were done by\\r\\nMiss Dashwood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hum\"--said Mrs. Ferrars--\"very pretty,\"--and without regarding them\\r\\nat all, returned them to her daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude\\r\\nenough,--for, colouring a little, she immediately said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are very pretty, ma\\'am--an\\'t they?\" But then again, the dread of\\r\\nhaving been too civil, too encouraging herself, probably came over\\r\\nher, for she presently added, \"Do you not think they are something in\\r\\nMiss Morton\\'s style of painting, Ma\\'am?--She _does_ paint most\\r\\ndelightfully!--How beautifully her last landscape is done!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Beautifully indeed! But _she_ does every thing well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne could not bear this. She was already greatly displeased with\\r\\nMrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed praise of another, at Elinor\\'s\\r\\nexpense, though she had not any notion of what was principally meant\\r\\nby it, provoked her immediately to say with warmth--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is admiration of a very particular kind! what is Miss Morton to\\r\\nus? who knows, or who cares, for her?--it is Elinor of whom _we_ think\\r\\nand speak.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so saying, she took the screens out of her sister-in-law\\'s hands,\\r\\nto admire them herself as they ought to be admired.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Mrs. Ferrars._]\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing herself up more\\r\\nstiffly than ever, pronounced in retort this bitter philippic, \"Miss\\r\\nMorton is Lord Morton\\'s daughter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny looked very angry too, and her husband was all in a fright at\\r\\nhis sister\\'s audacity. Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne\\'s warmth\\r\\nthan she had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon\\'s eyes, as\\r\\nthey were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only what was\\r\\namiable in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a\\r\\nsister slighted in the smallest point.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne\\'s feelings did not stop here. The cold insolence of Mrs.\\r\\nFerrars\\'s general behaviour to her sister, seemed, to her, to foretell\\r\\nsuch difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her own wounded heart\\r\\ntaught her to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of\\r\\naffectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment, to her sister\\'s\\r\\nchair, and putting one arm round her neck, and one cheek close to\\r\\nhers, said in a low, but eager, voice--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear, dear Elinor, don\\'t mind them. Don\\'t let them make _you_\\r\\nunhappy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her\\r\\nface on Elinor\\'s shoulder, she burst into tears. Every body\\'s\\r\\nattention was called, and almost every body was concerned. Colonel\\r\\nBrandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did. Mrs.\\r\\nJennings, with a very intelligent \"Ah! poor dear,\" immediately gave\\r\\nher her salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the\\r\\nauthor of this nervous distress, that he instantly changed his seat to\\r\\none close by Lucy Steele, and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account\\r\\nof the whole shocking affair.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end\\r\\nto the bustle, and sit down among the rest; though her spirits\\r\\nretained the impression of what had passed, the whole evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor Marianne!\" said her brother to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice,\\r\\nas soon as he could secure his attention: \"She has not such good\\r\\nhealth as her sister,--she is very nervous,--she has not Elinor\\'s\\r\\nconstitution;--and one must allow that there is something very trying\\r\\nto a young woman who _has been_ a beauty in the loss of her personal\\r\\nattractions. You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne _was_\\r\\nremarkably handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor. Now\\r\\nyou see it is all gone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor\\'s curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied. She had found in\\r\\nher every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between\\r\\nthe families undesirable. She had seen enough of her pride, her\\r\\nmeanness, and her determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend\\r\\nall the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, and\\r\\nretarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been otherwise\\r\\nfree;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her _own_\\r\\nsake, that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any\\r\\nother of Mrs. Ferrars\\'s creation, preserved her from all dependence\\r\\nupon her caprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion. Or at least,\\r\\nif she did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward\\'s being\\r\\nfettered to Lucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable, she\\r\\n_ought_ to have rejoiced.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wondered that Lucy\\'s spirits could be so very much elevated by the\\r\\ncivility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest and her vanity should so\\r\\nvery much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid\\r\\nher because she was _not Elinor_ appear a compliment to herself--or to\\r\\nallow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her,\\r\\nbecause her real situation was unknown. But that it was so, had not\\r\\nonly been declared by Lucy\\'s eyes at the time, but was declared over\\r\\nagain the next morning more openly, for at her particular desire, Lady\\r\\nMiddleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing\\r\\nElinor alone, to tell her how happy she was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chance proved a lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon\\r\\nafter she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear friend,\" cried Lucy, as soon as they were by themselves, \"I\\r\\ncome to talk to you of my happiness. Could anything be so flattering\\r\\nas Mrs. Ferrars\\'s way of treating me yesterday? So exceeding affable\\r\\nas she was! You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her; but the\\r\\nvery moment I was introduced, there was such an affability in her\\r\\nbehaviour as really should seem to say, she had quite took a fancy to\\r\\nme. Now was not it so? You saw it all; and was not you quite struck\\r\\nwith it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She was certainly very civil to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?--I saw a vast deal\\r\\nmore. Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!--No pride,\\r\\nno hauteur, and your sister just the same--all sweetness and\\r\\naffability!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still pressed her to\\r\\nown that she had reason for her happiness; and Elinor was obliged to\\r\\ngo on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement,\" said she, \"nothing\\r\\ncould be more flattering than their treatment of you;--but as that was\\r\\nnot the case--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guessed you would say so,\" replied Lucy quickly--\"but there was no\\r\\nreason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she\\r\\ndid not, and her liking me is every thing. You shan\\'t talk me out of\\r\\nmy satisfaction. I am sure it will all end well, and there will be no\\r\\ndifficulties at all, to what I used to think. Mrs. Ferrars is a\\r\\ncharming woman, and so is your sister. They are both delightful women,\\r\\nindeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs.\\r\\nDashwood was!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this Elinor had no answer to make, and did not attempt any.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?--you seem low--you don\\'t speak;--sure you\\r\\nan\\'t well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never was in better health.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad of it with all my heart; but really you did not look it. I\\r\\nshould be sorry to have _you_ ill; you, that have been the greatest\\r\\ncomfort to me in the world!--Heaven knows what I should have done\\r\\nwithout your friendship.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting her own success.\\r\\nBut it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she directly replied--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me, and next to\\r\\nEdward\\'s love, it is the greatest comfort I have. Poor Edward!--But\\r\\nnow there is one good thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty\\r\\noften, for Lady Middleton\\'s delighted with Mrs. Dashwood, so we shall\\r\\nbe a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say, and Edward spends half\\r\\nhis time with his sister--besides, Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars\\r\\nwill visit now;--and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good\\r\\nto say more than once, they should always be glad to see me. They are\\r\\nsuch charming women!--I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I\\r\\nthink of her, you cannot speak too high.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she\\r\\n_should_ tell her sister. Lucy continued.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure I should have seen it in a moment, if Mrs. Ferrars had took\\r\\na dislike to me. If she had only made me a formal courtesy, for\\r\\ninstance, without saying a word, and never after had took any notice\\r\\nof me, and never looked at me in a pleasant way--you know what I\\r\\nmean--if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way, I should\\r\\nhave gave it all up in despair. I could not have stood it. For where\\r\\nshe _does_ dislike, I know it is most violent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph, by\\r\\nthe door\\'s being thrown open, the servant\\'s announcing Mr. Ferrars,\\r\\nand Edward\\'s immediately walking in.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each showed that\\r\\nit was so. They all looked exceedingly foolish; and Edward seemed to\\r\\nhave as great an inclination to walk out of the room again, as to\\r\\nadvance farther into it. The very circumstance, in its unpleasantest\\r\\nform, which they would each have been most anxious to avoid, had\\r\\nfallen on them. They were not only all three together, but were\\r\\ntogether without the relief of any other person. The ladies recovered\\r\\nthemselves first. It was not Lucy\\'s business to put herself forward,\\r\\nand the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up. She could\\r\\ntherefore only _look_ her tenderness, and after slightly addressing\\r\\nhim, said no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she, for his sake and\\r\\nher own, to do it well, that she forced herself, after a moment\\'s\\r\\nrecollection, to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost\\r\\neasy, and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still\\r\\nimproved them. She would not allow the presence of Lucy, nor the\\r\\nconsciousness of some injustice towards herself, to deter her from\\r\\nsaying that she was happy to see him, and that she had very much\\r\\nregretted being from home, when he called before in Berkeley Street.\\r\\nShe would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which, as\\r\\na friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the observant eyes\\r\\nof Lucy, though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he had courage\\r\\nenough to sit down; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the\\r\\nladies in a proportion, which the case rendered reasonable, though his\\r\\nsex might make it rare; for his heart had not the indifference of\\r\\nLucy\\'s, nor could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined to make no\\r\\ncontribution to the comfort of the others, and would not say a word;\\r\\nand almost every thing that _was_ said, proceeded from Elinor, who was\\r\\nobliged to volunteer all the information about her mother\\'s health,\\r\\ntheir coming to town, &c. which Edward ought to have inquired about,\\r\\nbut never did.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer exertions did not stop here; for she soon afterwards felt herself\\r\\nso heroically disposed as to determine, under pretence of fetching\\r\\nMarianne, to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it,\\r\\nand _that_ in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away several\\r\\nminutes on the landing-place, with the most high-minded fortitude,\\r\\nbefore she went to her sister. When that was once done, however, it\\r\\nwas time for the raptures of Edward to cease; for Marianne\\'s joy\\r\\nhurried her into the drawing-room immediately. Her pleasure in seeing\\r\\nhim was like every other of her feelings, strong in itself, and\\r\\nstrongly spoken. She met him with a hand that would be taken, and a\\r\\nvoice that expressed the affection of a sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear Edward!\" she cried, \"this is a moment of great happiness!--This\\r\\nwould almost make amends for every thing!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward tried to return her kindness as it deserved, but before such\\r\\nwitnesses he dared not say half what he really felt. Again they all\\r\\nsat down, and for a moment or two all were silent; while Marianne was\\r\\nlooking with the most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and\\r\\nsometimes at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each other\\r\\nshould be checked by Lucy\\'s unwelcome presence. Edward was the first\\r\\nto speak, and it was to notice Marianne\\'s altered looks, and express\\r\\nhis fear of her not finding London agree with her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, don\\'t think of me!\" she replied with spirited earnestness, though\\r\\nher eyes were filled with tears as she spoke, \"don\\'t think of _my_\\r\\nhealth. Elinor is well, you see. That must be enough for us both.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy, nor\\r\\nto conciliate the good will of Lucy, who looked up at Marianne with no\\r\\nvery benignant expression.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you like London?\" said Edward, willing to say any thing that might\\r\\nintroduce another subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all. I expected much pleasure in it, but I have found none.\\r\\nThe sight of you, Edward, is the only comfort it has afforded; and\\r\\nthank Heaven! you are what you always were!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused--no one spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think, Elinor,\" she presently added, \"we must employ Edward to take\\r\\ncare of us in our return to Barton. In a week or two, I suppose, we\\r\\nshall be going; and, I trust, Edward will not be very unwilling to\\r\\naccept the charge.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Edward muttered something, but what it was, nobody knew, not even\\r\\nhimself. But Marianne, who saw his agitation, and could easily trace\\r\\nit to whatever cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied,\\r\\nand soon talked of something else.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street yesterday! So dull, so\\r\\nwretchedly dull!--But I have much to say to you on that head, which\\r\\ncannot be said now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her\\r\\nfinding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever, and of her\\r\\nbeing particularly disgusted with his mother, till they were more in\\r\\nprivate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why were you not there, Edward?--Why did you not come?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was engaged elsewhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Engaged! But what was that, when such friends were to be met?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps, Miss Marianne,\" cried Lucy, eager to take some revenge on\\r\\nher, \"you think young men never stand upon engagements, if they have\\r\\nno mind to keep them, little as well as great.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the\\r\\nsting; for she calmly replied--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very sure that\\r\\nconscience only kept Edward from Harley Street. And I really believe\\r\\nhe _has_ the most delicate conscience in the world; the most\\r\\nscrupulous in performing every engagement, however minute, and however\\r\\nit may make against his interest or pleasure. He is the most fearful\\r\\nof giving pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of\\r\\nbeing selfish, of any body I ever saw. Edward, it is so, and I will\\r\\nsay it. What! are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you must\\r\\nbe no friend of mine; for those who will accept of my love and esteem,\\r\\nmust submit to my open commendation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nature of her commendation, in the present case, however, happened\\r\\nto be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her\\r\\nauditors, and was so very unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon\\r\\ngot up to go away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Going so soon!\" said Marianne; \"my dear Edward, this must not be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd drawing him a little aside, she whispered her persuasion that Lucy\\r\\ncould not stay much longer. But even this encouragement failed, for he\\r\\nwould go; and Lucy, who would have outstayed him, had his visit lasted\\r\\ntwo hours, soon afterwards went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can bring her here so often?\" said Marianne, on her leaving\\r\\nthem. \"Could not she see that we wanted her gone!--how teasing to\\r\\nEdward!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why so?--we were all his friends, and Lucy has been the longest known\\r\\nto him of any. It is but natural that he should like to see her as\\r\\nwell as ourselves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne looked at her steadily, and said, \"You know, Elinor, that\\r\\nthis is a kind of talking which I cannot bear. If you only hope to\\r\\nhave your assertion contradicted, as I must suppose to be the case,\\r\\nyou ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do\\r\\nit. I cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are not\\r\\nreally wanted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more,\\r\\nfor bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy, she could give\\r\\nno information that would convince Marianne; and painful as the\\r\\nconsequences of her still continuing in an error might be, she was\\r\\nobliged to submit to it. All that she could hope, was that Edward\\r\\nwould not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing\\r\\nMarianne\\'s mistaken warmth, nor to the repetition of any other part of\\r\\nthe pain that had attended their recent meeting--and this she had\\r\\nevery reason to expect.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Drawing him a little aside._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the\\r\\nworld, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq. was safely delivered of a\\r\\nson and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least\\r\\nto all those intimate connections who knew it before.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings\\'s happiness, produced a\\r\\ntemporary alteration in the disposal of her time, and influenced, in a\\r\\nlike degree, the engagements of her young friends; for as she wished\\r\\nto be as much as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every\\r\\nmorning as soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late in\\r\\nthe evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the\\r\\nMiddletons, spent the whole of every day, in Conduit Street. For their\\r\\nown comfort they would much rather have remained, at least all the\\r\\nmorning, in Mrs. Jennings\\'s house; but it was not a thing to be urged\\r\\nagainst the wishes of everybody. Their hours were therefore made over\\r\\nto Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in\\r\\nfact was as little valued, as it was professedly sought.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and\\r\\nby the latter they were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on\\r\\n_their_ ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to\\r\\nmonopolize. Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton\\'s\\r\\nbehaviour to Elinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all.\\r\\nBecause they neither flattered herself nor her children, she could not\\r\\nbelieve them good-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she\\r\\nfancied them satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to\\r\\nbe satirical; but _that_ did not signify. It was censure in common\\r\\nuse, and easily given.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy. It checked the\\r\\nidleness of one, and the business of the other. Lady Middleton was\\r\\nashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was\\r\\nproud to think of and administer at other times, she feared they would\\r\\ndespise her for offering. Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the\\r\\nthree, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her\\r\\nto it entirely. Would either of them only have given her a full and\\r\\nminute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr.\\r\\nWilloughby, she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the\\r\\nsacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner, which their\\r\\narrival occasioned. But this conciliation was not granted; for though\\r\\nshe often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and\\r\\nmore than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before\\r\\nMarianne, no effect was produced, but a look of indifference from the\\r\\nformer, or of disgust in the latter. An effort even yet lighter might\\r\\nhave made her their friend. Would they only have laughed at her about\\r\\nthe Doctor! But so little were they, anymore than the others, inclined\\r\\nto oblige her, that if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a\\r\\nwhole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject, than what\\r\\nshe was kind enough to bestow on herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these jealousies and discontents, however, were so totally\\r\\nunsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought it a delightful thing\\r\\nfor the girls to be together; and generally congratulated her young\\r\\nfriends every night, on having escaped the company of a stupid old\\r\\nwoman so long. She joined them sometimes at Sir John\\'s, sometimes at\\r\\nher own house; but wherever it was, she always came in excellent\\r\\nspirits, full of delight and importance, attributing Charlotte\\'s well\\r\\ndoing to her own care, and ready to give so exact, so minute a detail\\r\\nof her situation, as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.\\r\\nOne thing _did_ disturb her; and of that she made her daily complaint.\\r\\nMr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his\\r\\nsex, of all infants being alike; and though she could plainly\\r\\nperceive, at different times, the most striking resemblance between\\r\\nthis baby and every one of his relations on both sides, there was no\\r\\nconvincing his father of it; no persuading him to believe that it was\\r\\nnot exactly like every other baby of the same age; nor could he even\\r\\nbe brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the\\r\\nfinest child in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nI come now to the relation of a misfortune, which about this time\\r\\nbefell Mrs. John Dashwood. It so happened that while her two sisters\\r\\nwith Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street, another\\r\\nof her acquaintance had dropt in--a circumstance in itself not\\r\\napparently likely to produce evil to her. But while the imaginations\\r\\nof other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our\\r\\nconduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one\\'s happiness\\r\\nmust in some measure be always at the mercy of chance. In the present\\r\\ninstance, this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun\\r\\ntruth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the Miss\\r\\nDashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood\\'s sisters, she\\r\\nimmediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this\\r\\nmisconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of\\r\\ninvitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a\\r\\nsmall musical party at her house. The consequence of which was, that\\r\\nMrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly\\r\\ngreat inconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods,\\r\\nbut, what was still worse, must be subject to all the unpleasantness\\r\\nof appearing to treat them with attention: and who could tell that\\r\\nthey might not expect to go out with her a second time? The power of\\r\\ndisappointing them, it was true, must always be her\\'s. But that was\\r\\nnot enough; for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which\\r\\nthey know to be wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any\\r\\nthing better from them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of\\r\\ngoing out every day, that it was become a matter of indifference to\\r\\nher, whether she went or not: and she prepared quietly and\\r\\nmechanically for every evening\\'s engagement, though without expecting\\r\\nthe smallest amusement from any, and very often without knowing, till\\r\\nthe last moment, where it was to take her.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent, as\\r\\nnot to bestow half the consideration on it, during the whole of her\\r\\ntoilet, which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes\\r\\nof their being together, when it was finished. Nothing escaped _her_\\r\\nminute observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing, and\\r\\nasked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price of every\\r\\npart of Marianne\\'s dress; could have guessed the number of her gowns\\r\\naltogether with better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not\\r\\nwithout hopes of finding out before they parted, how much her washing\\r\\ncost per week, and how much she had every year to spend upon herself.\\r\\nThe impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover, was generally\\r\\nconcluded with a compliment, which though meant as its douceur, was\\r\\nconsidered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all; for after\\r\\nundergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown, the\\r\\ncolour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair, she was almost\\r\\nsure of being told that upon \"her word she looked vastly smart, and\\r\\nshe dared to say she would make a great many conquests.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such encouragement as this, was she dismissed on the present\\r\\noccasion, to her brother\\'s carriage; which they were ready to enter\\r\\nfive minutes after it stopped at the door, a punctuality not very\\r\\nagreeable to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house\\r\\nof her acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay on their part\\r\\nthat might inconvenience either herself or her coachman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe events of this evening were not very remarkable. The party, like\\r\\nother musical parties, comprehended a great many people who had real\\r\\ntaste for the performance, and a great many more who had none at all;\\r\\nand the performers themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,\\r\\nand that of their immediate friends, the first private performers in\\r\\nEngland.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so, she made no\\r\\nscruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte, whenever it\\r\\nsuited her, and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp, and\\r\\nvioloncello, would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the\\r\\nroom. In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of\\r\\nyoung men, the very he, who had given them a lecture on\\r\\ntoothpick-cases at Gray\\'s. She perceived him soon afterwards looking\\r\\nat herself, and speaking familiarly to her brother; and had just\\r\\ndetermined to find out his name from the latter, when they both came\\r\\ntowards her, and Mr. Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert\\r\\nFerrars.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe addressed her with easy civility, and twisted his head into a bow\\r\\nwhich assured her as plainly as words could have done, that he was\\r\\nexactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy. Happy\\r\\nhad it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended less on his\\r\\nown merit, than on the merit of his nearest relations! For then his\\r\\nbrother\\'s bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the\\r\\nill-humour of his mother and sister would have begun. But while she\\r\\nwondered at the difference of the two young men, she did not find that\\r\\nthe emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out of all charity with\\r\\nthe modesty and worth of the other. Why they _were_ different, Robert\\r\\nexclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour\\'s\\r\\nconversation; for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme\\r\\n_gaucherie_ which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper\\r\\nsociety, he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any\\r\\nnatural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education;\\r\\nwhile he himself, though probably without any particular, any material\\r\\nsuperiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,\\r\\nwas as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my soul,\" he added, \"I believe it is nothing more; and so I\\r\\noften tell my mother, when she is grieving about it. \\'My dear Madam,\\'\\r\\nI always say to her, \\'you must make yourself easy. The evil is now\\r\\nirremediable, and it has been entirely your own doing. Why would you\\r\\nbe persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your own judgment, to\\r\\nplace Edward under private tuition, at the most critical time of his\\r\\nlife? If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself,\\r\\ninstead of sending him to Mr. Pratt\\'s, all this would have been\\r\\nprevented.\\' This is the way in which I always consider the matter, and\\r\\nmy mother is perfectly convinced of her error.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor would not oppose his opinion, because, whatever might be her\\r\\ngeneral estimation of the advantage of a public school, she could not\\r\\nthink of Edward\\'s abode in Mr. Pratt\\'s family, with any satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You reside in Devonshire, I think,\"--was his next observation, \"in a\\r\\ncottage near Dawlish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor set him right as to its situation; and it seemed rather\\r\\nsurprising to him that anybody could live in Devonshire, without\\r\\nliving near Dawlish. He bestowed his hearty approbation however on\\r\\ntheir species of house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For my own part,\" said he, \"I am excessively fond of a cottage; there\\r\\nis always so much comfort, so much elegance about them. And I protest,\\r\\nif I had any money to spare, I should buy a little land and build one\\r\\nmyself, within a short distance of London, where I might drive myself\\r\\ndown at any time, and collect a few friends about me, and be happy. I\\r\\nadvise every body who is going to build, to build a cottage. My friend\\r\\nLord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,\\r\\nand laid before me three different plans of Bonomi\\'s. I was to decide\\r\\non the best of them. \\'My dear Courtland,\\' said I, immediately throwing\\r\\nthem all into the fire, \\'do not adopt either of them, but by all means\\r\\nbuild a cottage.\\' And that I fancy, will be the end of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations, no space in\\r\\na cottage; but this is all a mistake. I was last month at my friend\\r\\nElliott\\'s, near Dartford. Lady Elliott wished to give a dance. \\'But\\r\\nhow can it be done?\\' said she; \\'my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it is\\r\\nto be managed. There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten\\r\\ncouple, and where can the supper be?\\' I immediately saw that there\\r\\ncould be no difficulty in it, so I said, \\'My dear Lady Elliott, do not\\r\\nbe uneasy. The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;\\r\\ncard-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library may be open\\r\\nfor tea and other refreshments; and let the supper be set out in the\\r\\nsaloon.\\' Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought. We measured the\\r\\ndining-room, and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the\\r\\naffair was arranged precisely after my plan. So that, in fact, you\\r\\nsee, if people do but know how to set about it, every comfort may be\\r\\nas well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the\\r\\ncompliment of rational opposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister,\\r\\nhis mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else; and a\\r\\nthought struck him during the evening, which he communicated to his\\r\\nwife, for her approbation, when they got home. The consideration of\\r\\nMrs. Dennison\\'s mistake, in supposing his sisters their guests, had\\r\\nsuggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such,\\r\\nwhile Mrs. Jennings\\'s engagements kept her from home. The expense\\r\\nwould be nothing, the inconvenience not more; and it was altogether an\\r\\nattention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be\\r\\nrequisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his\\r\\nfather. Fanny was startled at the proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not see how it can be done,\" said she, \"without affronting Lady\\r\\nMiddleton, for they spend every day with her; otherwise I should be\\r\\nexceedingly glad to do it. You know I am always ready to pay them any\\r\\nattention in my power, as my taking them out this evening shows. But\\r\\nthey are Lady Middleton\\'s visitors. How can I ask them away from her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband, but with great humility, did not see the force of her\\r\\nobjection. \"They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit\\r\\nStreet, and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the\\r\\nsame number of days to such near relations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My love I would ask them with all my heart, if it was in my power.\\r\\nBut I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend\\r\\na few days with us. They are very well behaved, good kind of girls;\\r\\nand I think the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very\\r\\nwell by Edward. We can ask your sisters some other year, you know; but\\r\\nthe Miss Steeles may not be in town any more. I am sure you will like\\r\\nthem; indeed, you _do_ like them, you know, very much already, and so\\r\\ndoes my mother; and they are such favourites with Harry!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dashwood was convinced. He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss\\r\\nSteeles immediately, and his conscience was pacified by the resolution\\r\\nof inviting his sisters another year; at the same time, however, slyly\\r\\nsuspecting that another year would make the invitation needless, by\\r\\nbringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon\\'s wife, and Marianne as\\r\\n_their_ visitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of the ready wit that had\\r\\nprocured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy, to request her company\\r\\nand her sister\\'s, for some days, in Harley Street, as soon as Lady\\r\\nMiddleton could spare them. This was enough to make Lucy really and\\r\\nreasonably happy. Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her,\\r\\nherself; cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views! Such\\r\\nan opportunity of being with Edward and his family was, above all\\r\\nthings, the most material to her interest, and such an invitation the\\r\\nmost gratifying to her feelings! It was an advantage that could not\\r\\nbe too gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of; and the\\r\\nvisit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had any precise limits,\\r\\nwas instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days\\'\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten minutes after\\r\\nits arrival, it gave her, for the first time, some share in the\\r\\nexpectations of Lucy; for such a mark of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed\\r\\non so short an acquaintance, seemed to declare that the good-will\\r\\ntowards her arose from something more than merely malice against\\r\\nherself; and might be brought, by time and address, to do every thing\\r\\nthat Lucy wished. Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady\\r\\nMiddleton, and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John\\r\\nDashwood; and these were effects that laid open the probability of\\r\\ngreater.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all that reached Elinor\\r\\nof their influence there, strengthened her expectation of the event.\\r\\nSir John, who called on them more than once, brought home such\\r\\naccounts of the favour they were in, as must be universally striking.\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in\\r\\nher life, as she was with them; had given each of them a needle book\\r\\nmade by some emigrant; called Lucy by her Christian name; and did not\\r\\nknow whether she should ever be able to part with them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight, that her mother\\r\\nfelt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her;\\r\\nand, contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day,\\r\\nreturned from that period to her own home, and her own habits, in\\r\\nwhich she found the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former\\r\\nshare.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in\\r\\nBerkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings, on returning from her ordinary visit\\r\\nto Mrs. Palmer, entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting by\\r\\nherself, with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to\\r\\nhear something wonderful; and giving her time only to form that idea,\\r\\nbegan directly to justify it, by saying--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am. What is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something so strange! But you shall hear it all. When I got to Mr.\\r\\nPalmer\\'s, I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child. She was\\r\\nsure it was very ill--it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.\\r\\nSo I looked at it directly, and, \\'Lord! my dear,\\' says I, \\'it is\\r\\nnothing in the world, but the red gum--\\' and nurse said just the same.\\r\\nBut Charlotte, she would not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent\\r\\nfor; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he\\r\\nstepped over directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child, he said\\r\\njust as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, and\\r\\nthen Charlotte was easy. And so, just as he was going away again, it\\r\\ncame into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of\\r\\nit, but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news. So upon\\r\\nthat, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave, and seemed to know\\r\\nsomething or other, and at last he said in a whisper, \\'For fear any\\r\\nunpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to\\r\\ntheir sister\\'s indisposition, I think it advisable to say, that I\\r\\nbelieve there is no great reason for alarm; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will\\r\\ndo very well.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! is Fanny ill?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _In a whisper._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is exactly what I said, my dear. \\'Lord!\\' says I, \\'is Mrs.\\r\\nDashwood ill?\\' So then it all came out; and the long and the short of\\r\\nthe matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this. Mr. Edward Ferrars,\\r\\nthe very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it\\r\\nturns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it), Mr.\\r\\nEdward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to\\r\\nmy cousin Lucy! There\\'s for you, my dear! And not a creature knowing a\\r\\nsyllable of the matter, except Nancy! Could you have believed such a\\r\\nthing possible? There is no great wonder in their liking one another;\\r\\nbut that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody\\r\\nsuspect it! _That_ is strange! I never happened to see them together,\\r\\nor I am sure I should have found it out directly. Well, and so this\\r\\nwas kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor\\r\\nyour brother or sister suspected a word of the matter: till this very\\r\\nmorning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well-meaning creature, but no\\r\\nconjurer, popt it all out. \\'Lord!\\' thinks she to herself, \\'they are\\r\\nall so fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about\\r\\nit;\\' and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all alone\\r\\nat her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to come--for she had\\r\\njust been saying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she\\r\\nthought to make a match between Edward and some Lord\\'s daughter or\\r\\nother, I forget who. So you may think what a blow it was to all her\\r\\nvanity and pride. She fell into violent hysterics immediately, with\\r\\nsuch screams as reached your brother\\'s ears, as he was sitting in his\\r\\nown dressing-room down stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his\\r\\nsteward in the country. So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene\\r\\ntook place, for Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming\\r\\nwhat was going on. Poor soul! I pity _her._ And I must say, I think\\r\\nshe was used very hardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and\\r\\nsoon drove her into a fainting fit. Nancy, she fell upon her knees,\\r\\nand cried bitterly; and your brother, he walked about the room, and\\r\\nsaid he did not know what to do. Mrs. Dashwood declared they should\\r\\nnot stay a minute longer in the house, and your brother was forced to\\r\\ngo down upon _his_ knees too, to persuade her to let them stay till\\r\\nthey had packed up their clothes. _Then_ she fell into hysterics\\r\\nagain, and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan,\\r\\nand Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar. The carriage was\\r\\nat the door ready to take my poor cousins away, and they were just\\r\\nstepping in as he came off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says,\\r\\nshe could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad. I declare, I\\r\\nhave no patience with your sister; and I hope, with all my heart, it\\r\\nwill be a match in spite of her. Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward\\r\\nwill be in when he hears of it! To have his love used so scornfully!\\r\\nfor they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may. I should not\\r\\nwonder, if he was to be in the greatest passion!--and Mr. Donavan\\r\\nthinks just the same. He and I had a great deal of talk about it; and\\r\\nthe best of all is, that he is gone back again to Harley Street, that\\r\\nhe may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she was\\r\\nsent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house, for your sister\\r\\nwas sure _she_ would be in hysterics too; and so she may, for what I\\r\\ncare. I have no pity for either of them. I have no notion of people\\'s\\r\\nmaking such a to-do about money and greatness. There is no reason on\\r\\nearth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry; for I am sure Mrs.\\r\\nFerrars may afford to do very well by her son, and though Lucy has\\r\\nnext to nothing herself, she knows better than any body how to make\\r\\nthe most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow\\r\\nhim five hundred a-year, she would make as good an appearance with it\\r\\nas any body else would with eight. Lord! how snug they might live in\\r\\nsuch another cottage as yours--or a little bigger--with two maids, and\\r\\ntwo men; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my Betty\\r\\nhas a sister out of place, that would fit them exactly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had time enough to\\r\\ncollect her thoughts, she was able to give such an answer, and make\\r\\nsuch observations, as the subject might naturally be supposed to\\r\\nproduce. Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary\\r\\ninterest in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late often hoped\\r\\nmight be the case) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to\\r\\nEdward; and happy above all the rest, in the absence of Marianne, she\\r\\nfelt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and\\r\\nto give her judgment, as she believed, with impartiality on the\\r\\nconduct of every one concerned in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event\\r\\nreally was; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its\\r\\nbeing possible to end otherwise at last, than in the marriage of\\r\\nEdward and Lucy. What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there\\r\\ncould not be a doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear; and still\\r\\nmore anxious to know how Edward would conduct himself. For _him_ she\\r\\nfelt much compassion;--for Lucy very little--and it cost her some\\r\\npains to procure that little;--for the rest of the party none at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject, Elinor soon saw the\\r\\nnecessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion. No time was to be\\r\\nlost in undeceiving her, in making her acquainted with the real truth,\\r\\nand in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,\\r\\nwithout betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister, or any\\r\\nresentment against Edward.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor\\'s office was a painful one. She was going to remove what she\\r\\nreally believed to be her sister\\'s chief consolation,--to give such\\r\\nparticulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her\\r\\ngood opinion,-and to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their\\r\\nsituations, which to _her_ fancy would seem strong, feel all her own\\r\\ndisappointment over again. But unwelcome as such a task must be, it\\r\\nwas necessary to be done, and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings, or to\\r\\nrepresent herself as suffering much, any otherwise than as the\\r\\nself-command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward\\'s\\r\\nengagement, might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.\\r\\nHer narration was clear and simple; and though it could not be given\\r\\nwithout emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation, nor\\r\\nimpetuous grief. _That_ belonged rather to the hearer, for Marianne\\r\\nlistened with horror, and cried excessively. Elinor was to be the\\r\\ncomforter of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs; and\\r\\nall the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure\\r\\nof mind, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge\\r\\nbut of imprudence, was readily offered.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Marianne for some time would give credit to neither. Edward seemed\\r\\na second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she _had_\\r\\nloved him most sincerely, could she feel less than herself! As for\\r\\nLucy Steele, she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely\\r\\nincapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could not be persuaded\\r\\nat first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection of\\r\\nEdward for her. She would not even admit it to have been natural; and\\r\\nElinor left her to be convinced that it was so, by that which only\\r\\ncould convince her, a better knowledge of mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact\\r\\nof the engagement, and the length of time it had existed. Marianne\\'s\\r\\nfeelings had then broken in, and put an end to all regularity of\\r\\ndetail; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her\\r\\ndistress, lessen her alarms, and combat her resentment. The first\\r\\nquestion on her side, which led to farther particulars, was--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has he written to you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have known it these four months. When Lucy first came to Barton\\r\\nPark last November, she told me in confidence of her engagement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt these words, Marianne\\'s eyes expressed the astonishment which her\\r\\nlips could not utter. After a pause of wonder, she exclaimed--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Four months!--Have you known of this four months?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor confirmed it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What!--while attending me in all my misery, has this been on your\\r\\nheart?--And I have reproached you for being happy!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Four months!\" cried Marianne again. \"So calm! so cheerful! how have\\r\\nyou been supported?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By feeling that I was doing my duty. My promise to Lucy, obliged me\\r\\nto be secret. I owed it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of\\r\\nthe truth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in\\r\\nthem a solicitude about me, which it could not be in my power to\\r\\nsatisfy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne seemed much struck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother,\" added\\r\\nElinor; \"and once or twice I have attempted it; but without betraying\\r\\nmy trust, I never could have convinced you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Four months! and yet you loved him!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort of others\\r\\nwas dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt.\\r\\nNow, I can think and speak of it with little emotion. I would not have\\r\\nyou suffer on my account; for I assure you I no longer suffer\\r\\nmaterially myself. I have many things to support me. I am not\\r\\nconscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of\\r\\nmy own, I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it\\r\\nfarther. I acquit Edward of essential misconduct. I wish him very\\r\\nhappy; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty, that though now\\r\\nhe may harbour some regret, in the end he must become so. Lucy does\\r\\nnot want sense, and that is the foundation on which every thing good\\r\\nmay be built. And after all, Marianne, after all that is bewitching in\\r\\nthe idea of a single and constant attachment, and all that can be said\\r\\nof one\\'s happiness depending entirely on any particular person, it is\\r\\nnot meant--it is not fit--it is not possible that it should be so.\\r\\nEdward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior in person and\\r\\nunderstanding to half her sex; and time and habit will teach him to\\r\\nforget that he ever thought another superior to _her._\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If such is your way of thinking,\" said Marianne, \"if the loss of what\\r\\nis most valued is so easily to be made up by something else, your\\r\\nresolution, your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be\\r\\nwondered at. They are brought more within my comprehension.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I understand you. You do not suppose that I have ever felt much. For\\r\\nfour months, Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, without\\r\\nbeing at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it\\r\\nwould make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained\\r\\nto you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least. It was told\\r\\nme,--it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose\\r\\nprior engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought,\\r\\nwith triumph. This person\\'s suspicions, therefore, I have had to\\r\\noppose, by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most\\r\\ndeeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have had her\\r\\nhopes and exultation to listen to again and again. I have known myself\\r\\nto be divided from Edward for ever, without hearing one circumstance\\r\\nthat could make me less desire the connection. Nothing has proved him\\r\\nunworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me. I have had\\r\\nto contend against the unkindness of his sister, and the insolence of\\r\\nhis mother; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment, without\\r\\nenjoying its advantages. And all this has been going on at a time,\\r\\nwhen, as you know too well, it has not been my only unhappiness. If\\r\\nyou can think me capable of ever feeling, surely you may suppose that\\r\\nI have suffered _now._ The composure of mind with which I have brought\\r\\nmyself at present to consider the matter, the consolation that I have\\r\\nbeen willing to admit, have been the effect of constant and painful\\r\\nexertion; they did not spring up of themselves; they did not occur to\\r\\nrelieve my spirits at first. No, Marianne. _Then_, if I had not been\\r\\nbound to silence, perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely--not\\r\\neven what I owed to my dearest friends--from openly showing that I was\\r\\n_very_ unhappy.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne was quite subdued.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Elinor,\" she cried, \"you have made me hate myself for ever. How\\r\\nbarbarous have I been to you!--you, who have been my only comfort, who\\r\\nhave borne with me in all my misery, who have seemed to be only\\r\\nsuffering for me! Is this my gratitude? Is this the only return I can\\r\\nmake you? Because your merit cries out upon myself, I have been trying\\r\\nto do it away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tenderest caresses followed this confession. In such a frame of\\r\\nmind as she was now in, Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her\\r\\nwhatever promise she required; and at her request, Marianne engaged\\r\\nnever to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of\\r\\nbitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of\\r\\ndislike to her;--and even to see Edward himself, if chance should\\r\\nbring them together, without any diminution of her usual cordiality.\\r\\nThese were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt that she had\\r\\ninjured, no reparation could be too much for her to make.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe performed her promise of being discreet, to admiration. She\\r\\nattended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with\\r\\nan unchanging complexion, dissented from her in nothing, and was heard\\r\\nthree times to say, \"Yes, ma\\'am.\"--She listened to her praise of Lucy\\r\\nwith only moving from one chair to another, and when Mrs. Jennings\\r\\ntalked of Edward\\'s affection, it cost her only a spasm in her throat.\\r\\nSuch advances towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel equal to\\r\\nany thing herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning brought a farther trial of it, in a visit from their\\r\\nbrother, who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful\\r\\naffair, and bring them news of his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have heard, I suppose,\" said he with great solemnity, as soon as\\r\\nhe was seated, \"of the very shocking discovery that took place under\\r\\nour roof yesterday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all looked their assent; it seemed too awful a moment for speech.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: \"_You have heard, I suppose._\"]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your sister,\" he continued, \"has suffered dreadfully. Mrs. Ferrars\\r\\ntoo--in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress--but\\r\\nI will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of\\r\\nus quite overcome. Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday. But\\r\\nI would not alarm you too much. Donavan says there is nothing\\r\\nmaterially to be apprehended; her constitution is a good one, and her\\r\\nresolution equal to any thing. She has borne it all, with the\\r\\nfortitude of an angel! She says she never shall think well of anybody\\r\\nagain; and one cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!--meeting\\r\\nwith such ingratitude, where so much kindness had been shown, so much\\r\\nconfidence had been placed! It was quite out of the benevolence of her\\r\\nheart, that she had asked these young women to her house; merely\\r\\nbecause she thought they deserved some attention, were harmless,\\r\\nwell-behaved girls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we\\r\\nboth wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us,\\r\\nwhile your kind friend there, was attending her daughter. And now to\\r\\nbe so rewarded! \\'I wish, with all my heart,\\' says poor Fanny in her\\r\\naffectionate way, \\'that we had asked your sisters instead of them.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere he stopped to be thanked; which being done, he went on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny broke it to her, is\\r\\nnot to be described. While she with the truest affection had been\\r\\nplanning a most eligible connection for him, was it to be supposed\\r\\nthat he could be all the time secretly engaged to another\\r\\nperson!--such a suspicion could never have entered her head! If she\\r\\nsuspected _any_ prepossession elsewhere, it could not be in _that_\\r\\nquarter. \\'_There_ to be sure,\\' said she, \\'I might have thought myself\\r\\nsafe.\\' She was quite in an agony. We consulted together, however, as\\r\\nto what should be done, and at last she determined to send for Edward.\\r\\nHe came. But I am sorry to relate what ensued. All that Mrs. Ferrars\\r\\ncould say to make him put an end to the engagement, assisted too as\\r\\nyou may well suppose by my arguments, and Fanny\\'s entreaties, was of\\r\\nno avail. Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded. I never\\r\\nthought Edward so stubborn, so unfeeling before. His mother explained\\r\\nto him her liberal designs, in case of his marrying Miss Morton; told\\r\\nhim she would settle on him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of\\r\\nland-tax, brings in a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters\\r\\ngrew desperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition to this,\\r\\nif he still persisted in this low connection, represented to him the\\r\\ncertain penury that must attend the match. His own two thousand pounds\\r\\nshe protested should be his all; she would never see him again; and so\\r\\nfar would she be from affording him the smallest assistance, that if\\r\\nhe were to enter into any profession with a view of better support,\\r\\nshe would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation, clapped her hands\\r\\ntogether, and cried, \"Gracious God! can this be possible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well may you wonder, Marianne,\" replied her brother, \"at the\\r\\nobstinacy which could resist such arguments as these. Your exclamation\\r\\nis very natural.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne was going to retort, but she remembered her promises, and\\r\\nforbore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All this, however,\" he continued, \"was urged in vain. Edward said\\r\\nvery little; but what he did say, was in the most determined manner.\\r\\nNothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement. He would\\r\\nstand to it, cost him what it might.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity, no longer able to be\\r\\nsilent, \"he has acted like an honest man! I beg your pardon, Mr.\\r\\nDashwood, but if he had done otherwise, I should have thought him a\\r\\nrascal. I have some little concern in the business, as well as\\r\\nyourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there is not a\\r\\nbetter kind of girl in the world, nor one who more deserves a good\\r\\nhusband.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature was calm, not\\r\\nopen to provocation, and he never wished to offend anybody, especially\\r\\nanybody of good fortune. He therefore replied, without any\\r\\nresentment--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours,\\r\\nmadam. Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say, a very deserving young woman,\\r\\nbut in the present case you know, the connection must be impossible.\\r\\nAnd to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under\\r\\nher uncle\\'s care, the son of a woman especially of such very large\\r\\nfortune as Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, altogether a little\\r\\nextraordinary. In short, I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour\\r\\nof any person whom you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings. We all wish\\r\\nher extremely happy; and Mrs. Ferrars\\'s conduct throughout the whole,\\r\\nhas been such as every conscientious, good mother, in like\\r\\ncircumstances, would adopt. It has been dignified and liberal. Edward\\r\\nhas drawn his own lot, and I fear it will be a bad one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne sighed out her similar apprehension; and Elinor\\'s heart wrung\\r\\nfor the feelings of Edward, while braving his mother\\'s threats, for a\\r\\nwoman who could not reward him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, sir,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"and how did it end?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry to say, ma\\'am, in a most unhappy rupture:--Edward is\\r\\ndismissed for ever from his mother\\'s notice. He left her house\\r\\nyesterday, but where he is gone, or whether he is still in town, I do\\r\\nnot know; for _we_ of course can make no inquiry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor young man!--and what is to become of him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, indeed, ma\\'am! It is a melancholy consideration. Born to the\\r\\nprospect of such affluence! I cannot conceive a situation more\\r\\ndeplorable. The interest of two thousand pounds--how can a man live on\\r\\nit?--and when to that is added the recollection, that he might, but\\r\\nfor his own folly, within three months have been in the receipt of two\\r\\nthousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has thirty thousand\\r\\npounds,) I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition. We must\\r\\nall feel for him; and the more so, because it is totally out of our\\r\\npower to assist him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor young man!\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"I am sure he should be very\\r\\nwelcome to bed and board at my house; and so I would tell him if I\\r\\ncould see him. It is not fit that he should be living about at his own\\r\\ncharge now, at lodgings and taverns.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor\\'s heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward, though\\r\\nshe could not forbear smiling at the form of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he would only have done as well by himself,\" said John Dashwood,\\r\\n\"as all his friends were disposed to do by him, he might now have been\\r\\nin his proper situation, and would have wanted for nothing. But as it\\r\\nis, it must be out of anybody\\'s power to assist him. And there is one\\r\\nthing more preparing against him, which must be worse than all--his\\r\\nmother has determined, with a very natural kind of spirit, to settle\\r\\n_that_ estate upon Robert immediately, which might have been Edward\\'s,\\r\\non proper conditions. I left her this morning with her lawyer,\\r\\ntalking over the business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Talking over the business._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well!\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"that is _her_ revenge. Everybody has a\\r\\nway of their own. But I don\\'t think mine would be, to make one son\\r\\nindependent, because another had plagued me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne got up and walked about the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man,\" continued John,\\r\\n\"than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which\\r\\nmight have been his own? Poor Edward! I feel for him sincerely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion, concluded his\\r\\nvisit; and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really\\r\\nbelieved there was no material danger in Fanny\\'s indisposition, and\\r\\nthat they need not therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away;\\r\\nleaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present\\r\\noccasion, as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars\\'s conduct, the\\r\\nDashwoods\\', and Edward\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne\\'s indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room; and\\r\\nas her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in\\r\\nMrs. Jennings, they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the\\r\\nparty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward\\'s conduct, but\\r\\nonly Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit. _They_ only knew\\r\\nhow little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient, and how small\\r\\nwas the consolation, beyond the consciousness of doing right, that\\r\\ncould remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune. Elinor gloried\\r\\nin his integrity; and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion\\r\\nfor his punishment. But though confidence between them was, by this\\r\\npublic discovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject\\r\\non which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone. Elinor\\r\\navoided it upon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her\\r\\nthoughts, by the too warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that\\r\\nbelief of Edward\\'s continued affection for herself which she rather\\r\\nwished to do away; and Marianne\\'s courage soon failed her, in trying\\r\\nto converse upon a topic which always left her more dissatisfied with\\r\\nherself than ever, by the comparison it necessarily produced between\\r\\nElinor\\'s conduct and her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe felt all the force of that comparison; but not as her sister had\\r\\nhoped, to urge her to exertion now; she felt it with all the pain of\\r\\ncontinual self-reproach, regretted most bitterly that she had never\\r\\nexerted herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,\\r\\nwithout the hope of amendment. Her mind was so much weakened that she\\r\\nstill fancied present exertion impossible, and therefore it only\\r\\ndispirited her more.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards, of affairs\\r\\nin Harley Street, or Bartlett\\'s Buildings. But though so much of the\\r\\nmatter was known to them already, that Mrs. Jennings might have had\\r\\nenough to do in spreading that knowledge farther, without seeking\\r\\nafter more, she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort\\r\\nand inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could; and nothing but the\\r\\nhindrance of more visitors than usual, had prevented her going to them\\r\\nwithin that time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars, was so\\r\\nfine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens,\\r\\nthough it was only the second week in March. Mrs. Jennings and Elinor\\r\\nwere of the number; but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were\\r\\nagain in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them, chose rather\\r\\nto stay at home, than venture into so public a place.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they\\r\\nentered the Gardens, and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing\\r\\nwith them, and engaging all Mrs. Jennings\\'s conversation, she was\\r\\nherself left to quiet reflection. She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,\\r\\nnothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody who could by\\r\\nany chance whether grave or gay, be interesting to her. But at last\\r\\nshe found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele, who,\\r\\nthough looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting\\r\\nthem, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of\\r\\nMrs. Jennings, left her own party for a short time, to join their\\'s.\\r\\nMrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get it all out of her, my dear. She will tell you any thing if you\\r\\nask. You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings\\'s curiosity and Elinor\\'s too,\\r\\nthat she would tell any thing _without_ being asked; for nothing would\\r\\notherwise have been learnt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am so glad to meet you;\" said Miss Steele, taking her familiarly by\\r\\nthe arm--\"for I wanted to see you of all things in the world.\" And\\r\\nthen lowering her voice, \"I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about\\r\\nit. Is she angry?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all, I believe, with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a good thing. And Lady Middleton, is _she_ angry?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot suppose it possible that she should.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am monstrous glad of it. Good gracious! I have had such a time of\\r\\nit! I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life. She vowed at first she\\r\\nwould never trim me up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me\\r\\nagain, so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to, and we are\\r\\nas good friends as ever. Look, she made me this bow to my hat, and put\\r\\nin the feather last night. There now, _you_ are going to laugh at me\\r\\ntoo. But why should not I wear pink ribbons? I do not care if it _is_\\r\\nthe Doctor\\'s favourite colour. I am sure, for my part, I should never\\r\\nhave known he _did_ like it better than any other colour, if he had\\r\\nnot happened to say so. My cousins have been so plaguing me! I declare\\r\\nsometimes I do not know which way to look before them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say,\\r\\nand therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to\\r\\nthe first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, but Miss Dashwood,\" speaking triumphantly, \"people may say what\\r\\nthey choose about Mr. Ferrars\\'s declaring he would not have Lucy, for\\r\\nit is no such thing I can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such\\r\\nill-natured reports to be spread abroad. Whatever Lucy might think\\r\\nabout it herself, you know, it was no business of other people to set\\r\\nit down for certain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before, I assure you,\"\\r\\nsaid Elinor.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: \"_She put in the feather last night._\"]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, did not you? But it _was_ said, I know, very well, and by more\\r\\nthan one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses\\r\\ncould expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with\\r\\nthirty thousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had\\r\\nnothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself. And besides\\r\\nthat, my cousin Richard said himself, that when it came to the point\\r\\nhe was afraid Mr. Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come\\r\\nnear us for three days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I\\r\\nbelieve in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away\\r\\nfrom your brother\\'s Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all\\r\\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday, and did not know what was become of\\r\\nhim. Once Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits rose\\r\\nagainst that. However this morning he came just as we came home from\\r\\nchurch; and then it all came out, how he had been sent for Wednesday\\r\\nto Harley Street, and been talked to by his mother and all of them,\\r\\nand how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy,\\r\\nand nobody but Lucy would he have. And how he had been so worried by\\r\\nwhat passed, that as soon as he had went away from his mother\\'s house,\\r\\nhe had got upon his horse, and rid into the country, some where or\\r\\nother; and how he had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday,\\r\\non purpose to get the better of it. And after thinking it all over and\\r\\nover again, he said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune,\\r\\nand no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the\\r\\nengagement, because it must be for her loss, for he had nothing but\\r\\ntwo thousand pounds, and no hope of any thing else; and if he was to\\r\\ngo into orders, as he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a\\r\\ncuracy, and how was they to live upon that?--He could not bear to\\r\\nthink of her doing no better, and so he begged, if she had the least\\r\\nmind for it, to put an end to the matter directly, and leave him shift\\r\\nfor himself. I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be.\\r\\nAnd it was entirely for _her_ sake, and upon _her_ account, that he\\r\\nsaid a word about being off, and not upon his own. I will take my oath\\r\\nhe never dropt a syllable of being tired of her, or of wishing to\\r\\nmarry Miss Morton, or any thing like it. But, to be sure, Lucy would\\r\\nnot give ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directly (with a\\r\\ngreat deal about sweet and love, you know, and all that--Oh, la! one\\r\\ncan\\'t repeat such kind of things you know)--she told him directly, she\\r\\nhad not the least mind in the world to be off, for she could live with\\r\\nhim upon a trifle, and how little so ever he might have, she should be\\r\\nvery glad to have it all, you know, or something of the kind. So then\\r\\nhe was monstrous happy, and talked on some time about what they should\\r\\ndo, and they agreed he should take orders directly, and they must wait\\r\\nto be married till he got a living. And just then I could not hear any\\r\\nmore, for my cousin called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was\\r\\ncome in her coach, and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so\\r\\nI was forced to go into the room and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if\\r\\nshe would like to go, but she did not care to leave Edward; so I just\\r\\nrun up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with\\r\\nthe Richardsons.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them,\" said Elinor;\\r\\n\"you were all in the same room together, were not you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, not us. La! Miss Dashwood, do you think people make love\\r\\nwhen any body else is by? Oh, for shame!--To be sure you must know\\r\\nbetter than that. (Laughing affectedly.)--No, no; they were shut up in\\r\\nthe drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening at\\r\\nthe door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How!\" cried Elinor; \"have you been repeating to me what you only\\r\\nlearnt yourself by listening at the door? I am sorry I did not know it\\r\\nbefore; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me\\r\\nparticulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known\\r\\nyourself. How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, la! there is nothing in _that._ I only stood at the door, and\\r\\nheard what I could. And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same\\r\\nby me; for a year or two back, when Martha Sharpe and I had so many\\r\\nsecrets together, she never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or\\r\\nbehind a chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss Steele could not be\\r\\nkept beyond a couple of minutes, from what was uppermost in her mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Listening at the door._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Edward talks of going to Oxford soon,\" said she; \"but now he is\\r\\nlodging at No. --, Pall Mall. What an ill-natured woman his mother is,\\r\\nan\\'t she? And your brother and sister were not very kind! However, I\\r\\nshan\\'t say anything against them to _you_; and to be sure they did\\r\\nsend us home in their own chariot, which was more than I looked for.\\r\\nAnd for my part, I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask\\r\\nus for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however,\\r\\nnothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine out of\\r\\nsight. Edward have got some business at Oxford, he says; so he must go\\r\\nthere for a time; and after _that_, as soon as he can light upon a\\r\\nBishop, he will be ordained. I wonder what curacy he will get! Good\\r\\ngracious! (giggling as she spoke) I\\'d lay my life I know what my\\r\\ncousins will say, when they hear of it. They will tell me I should\\r\\nwrite to the Doctor, to get Edward the curacy of his new living. I\\r\\nknow they will; but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the\\r\\nworld. \\'La!\\' I shall say directly, \\'I wonder how you could think of\\r\\nsuch a thing? I write to the Doctor, indeed!\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Elinor, \"it is a comfort to be prepared against the\\r\\nworst. You have got your answer ready.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Steele was going to reply on the same subject, but the approach\\r\\nof her own party made another more necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, la! here come the Richardsons. I had a vast deal more to say to\\r\\nyou, but I must not stay away from them not any longer. I assure you\\r\\nthey are very genteel people. He makes a monstrous deal of money, and\\r\\nthey keep their own coach. I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings\\r\\nabout it myself, but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not\\r\\nin anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same; and if anything\\r\\nshould happen to take you and your sister away, and Mrs. Jennings\\r\\nshould want company, I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay\\r\\nwith her for as long a time as she likes. I suppose Lady Middleton\\r\\nwon\\'t ask us any more this bout. Good-bye; I am sorry Miss Marianne was\\r\\nnot here. Remember me kindly to her. La! if you have not got your\\r\\nspotted muslin on!--I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was her parting concern; for after this, she had time only to pay\\r\\nher farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings, before her company was\\r\\nclaimed by Mrs. Richardson; and Elinor was left in possession of\\r\\nknowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time, though\\r\\nshe had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen\\r\\nand foreplanned in her own mind. Edward\\'s marriage with Lucy was as\\r\\nfirmly determined on, and the time of its taking place remained as\\r\\nabsolutely uncertain, as she had concluded it would be;--every thing\\r\\ndepended, exactly after her expectation, on his getting that\\r\\npreferment, of which, at present, there seemed not the smallest\\r\\nchance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they returned to the carriage, Mrs. Jennings was eager for\\r\\ninformation; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible\\r\\nintelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained,\\r\\nshe confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple\\r\\nparticulars, as she felt assured that Lucy, for the sake of her own\\r\\nconsequence, would choose to have known. The continuance of their\\r\\nengagement, and the means that were able to be taken for promoting its\\r\\nend, was all her communication; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings\\r\\nthe following natural remark:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait for his having a living!--ay, we all know how _that_ will\\r\\nend:--they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding no good comes of it,\\r\\nwill set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a-year, with the interest\\r\\nof his two thousand pounds, and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr.\\r\\nPratt can give her. Then they will have a child every year! and Lord\\r\\nhelp \\'em! how poor they will be!--I must see what I can give them\\r\\ntowards furnishing their house. Two maids and two men, indeed!--as I\\r\\ntalked of t\\'other day. No, no, they must get a stout girl of all\\r\\nworks. Betty\\'s sister would never do for them _now._\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two-penny post from\\r\\nLucy herself. It was as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bartlett\\'s Building, March.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take\\r\\n     of writing to her; but I know your friendship for me will\\r\\n     make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and\\r\\n     my dear Edward, after all the troubles we have went through\\r\\n     lately, therefore will make no more apologies, but proceed\\r\\n     to say that, thank God! though we have suffered dreadfully,\\r\\n     we are both quite well now, and as happy as we must always\\r\\n     be in one another\\'s love. We have had great trials, and\\r\\n     great persecutions, but however, at the same time,\\r\\n     gratefully acknowledge many friends, yourself not the least\\r\\n     among them, whose great kindness I shall always thankfully\\r\\n     remember, as will Edward too, who I have told of it. I am\\r\\n     sure you will be glad to hear, as likewise dear Mrs.\\r\\n     Jennings, I spent two happy hours with him yesterday\\r\\n     afternoon, he would not hear of our parting, though\\r\\n     earnestly did I, as I thought my duty required, urge him to\\r\\n     it for prudence sake, and would have parted for ever on the\\r\\n     spot, would he consent to it; but he said it should never\\r\\n     be, he did not regard his mother\\'s anger, while he could\\r\\n     have my affections; our prospects are not very bright, to be\\r\\n     sure, but we must wait, and hope for the best; he will be\\r\\n     ordained shortly; and should it ever be in your power to\\r\\n     recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow, am\\r\\n     very sure you will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings\\r\\n     too, trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John, or\\r\\n     Mr. Palmer, or any friend that may be able to assist us.\\r\\n     Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did, but she did it\\r\\n     for the best, so I say nothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won\\'t\\r\\n     think it too much trouble to give us a call, should she come\\r\\n     this way any morning, \\'twould be a great kindness, and my\\r\\n     cousins would be proud to know her. My paper reminds me to\\r\\n     conclude; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully\\r\\n     remembered to her, and to Sir John, and Lady Middleton, and\\r\\n     the dear children, when you chance to see them, and love to\\r\\n     Miss Marianne,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am, etc., etc.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Elinor had finished it, she performed what she concluded to\\r\\nbe its writer\\'s real design, by placing it in the hands of Mrs.\\r\\nJennings, who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and\\r\\npraise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye, that was quite\\r\\nproper to let him be off if he would. That was just like Lucy. Poor\\r\\nsoul! I wish I _could_ get him a living, with all my heart. She calls\\r\\nme dear Mrs. Jennings, you see. She is a good-hearted girl as ever\\r\\nlived. Very well upon my word. That sentence is very prettily turned.\\r\\nYes, yes, I will go and see her, sure enough. How attentive she is, to\\r\\nthink of every body!--Thank you, my dear, for showing it me. It is as\\r\\npretty a letter as ever I saw, and does Lucy\\'s head and heart great\\r\\ncredit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town,\\r\\nand Marianne\\'s impatience to be gone increased every day. She sighed\\r\\nfor the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that\\r\\nif any place could give her ease, Barton must do it. Elinor was hardly\\r\\nless anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less\\r\\nbent on its being effected immediately, as that she was conscious of\\r\\nthe difficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be\\r\\nbrought to acknowledge. She began, however, seriously to turn her\\r\\nthoughts towards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their\\r\\nwishes to their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence\\r\\nof her good-will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining\\r\\nthem from home yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether\\r\\nmuch more eligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to\\r\\nCleveland about the end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs.\\r\\nJennings, with both her friends, received a very warm invitation from\\r\\nCharlotte to go with them. This would not, in itself, have been\\r\\nsufficient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood;--but it was enforced\\r\\nwith so much real politeness by Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the\\r\\nvery great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had\\r\\nbeen known to be unhappy, induced her to accept it with pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she told Marianne what she had done, however, her first reply was\\r\\nnot very auspicious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cleveland!\"--she cried, with great agitation. \"No, I cannot go to\\r\\nCleveland.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You forget,\" said Elinor gently, \"that its situation is not--that it\\r\\nis not in the neighbourhood of--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is in Somersetshire. I cannot go into Somersetshire. There,\\r\\nwhere I looked forward to going;--no, Elinor, you cannot expect me to\\r\\ngo there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such\\r\\nfeelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on\\r\\nothers;--represented it, therefore, as a measure which would fix the\\r\\ntime of her returning to that dear mother, whom she so much wished to\\r\\nsee, in a more eligible, more comfortable manner, than any other plan\\r\\ncould do, and perhaps without any greater delay. From Cleveland, which\\r\\nwas within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was not\\r\\nbeyond one day, though a long day\\'s journey; and their mother\\'s\\r\\nservant might easily come there to attend them down; and as there\\r\\ncould be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they\\r\\nmight now be at home in little more than three weeks\\' time. As\\r\\nMarianne\\'s affection for her mother was sincere, it must triumph with\\r\\nlittle difficulty, over the imaginary evils she had started.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest, that she\\r\\npressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland.\\r\\nElinor was grateful for the attention, but it could not alter her\\r\\ndesign; and their mother\\'s concurrence being readily gained, every\\r\\nthing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could\\r\\nbe;--and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the\\r\\nhours that were yet to divide her from Barton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! Colonel, I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss\\r\\nDashwoods;\"--was Mrs. Jennings\\'s address to him when he first called\\r\\non her, after their leaving her was settled--\"for they are quite\\r\\nresolved upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we shall\\r\\nbe, when I come back!--Lord! we shall sit and gape at one another as\\r\\ndull as two cats.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous sketch of their\\r\\nfuture ennui, to provoke him to make that offer, which might give\\r\\nhimself an escape from it; and if so, she had soon afterwards good\\r\\nreason to think her object gained; for, on Elinor\\'s moving to the\\r\\nwindow to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print, which she\\r\\nwas going to copy for her friend, he followed her to it with a look of\\r\\nparticular meaning, and conversed with her there for several minutes.\\r\\nThe effect of his discourse on the lady too, could not escape her\\r\\nobservation, for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even\\r\\nchanged her seat, on purpose that she might _not_ hear, to one close\\r\\nby the piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she could not keep\\r\\nherself from seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended with\\r\\nagitation, and was too intent on what he said to pursue her\\r\\nemployment. Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the\\r\\ninterval of Marianne\\'s turning from one lesson to another, some words\\r\\nof the Colonel\\'s inevitably reached her ear, in which he seemed to be\\r\\napologising for the badness of his house. This set the matter beyond a\\r\\ndoubt. She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary to do so;\\r\\nbut supposed it to be the proper etiquette. What Elinor said in reply\\r\\nshe could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her lips,\\r\\nthat she did not think _that_ any material objection;--and Mrs.\\r\\nJennings commended her in her heart for being so honest. They then\\r\\ntalked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable,\\r\\nwhen another lucky stop in Marianne\\'s performance brought her these\\r\\nwords in the Colonel\\'s calm voice,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAstonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech, she was almost\\r\\nready to cry out, \"Lord! what should hinder it?\"--but checking her\\r\\ndesire, confined herself to this silent ejaculation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis delay on the Colonel\\'s side, however, did not seem to offend or\\r\\nmortify his fair companion in the least, for on their breaking up the\\r\\nconference soon afterwards, and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings\\r\\nvery plainly heard Elinor say, and with a voice which showed her to\\r\\nfeel what she said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall always think myself very much obliged to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude, and only wondered that\\r\\nafter hearing such a sentence, the Colonel should be able to take\\r\\nleave of them, as he immediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and\\r\\ngo away without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old\\r\\nfriend could have made so indifferent a suitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat had really passed between them was to this effect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard,\" said he, with great compassion, \"of the injustice your\\r\\nfriend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family; for if I understand\\r\\nthe matter right, he has been entirely cast off by them for\\r\\npersevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman. Have\\r\\nI been rightly informed?--Is it so?--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor told him that it was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,\"--he replied, with great\\r\\nfeeling,--\"of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people\\r\\nlong attached to each other, is terrible. Mrs. Ferrars does not know\\r\\nwhat she may be doing--what she may drive her son to. I have seen Mr.\\r\\nFerrars two or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased with\\r\\nhim. He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted\\r\\nin a short time, but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for\\r\\nhis own sake, and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more. I\\r\\nunderstand that he intends to take orders. Will you be so good as to\\r\\ntell him that the living of Delaford, now just vacant, as I am\\r\\ninformed by this day\\'s post, is his, if he think it worth his\\r\\nacceptance--but _that_, perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he\\r\\nis now, it may be nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it were\\r\\nmore valuable. It is a rectory, but a small one; the late incumbent, I\\r\\nbelieve, did not make more than 200 L per annum, and though it is\\r\\ncertainly capable of improvement, I fear, not to such an amount as to\\r\\nafford him a very comfortable income. Such as it is, however, my\\r\\npleasure in presenting him to it, will be very great. Pray assure him\\r\\nof it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor\\'s astonishment at this commission could hardly have been\\r\\ngreater, had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand.\\r\\nThe preferment, which only two days before she had considered as\\r\\nhopeless for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry;--and\\r\\n_she_, of all people in the world, was fixed on to bestow it!--Her\\r\\nemotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different\\r\\ncause;--but whatever minor feelings less pure, less pleasing, might\\r\\nhave a share in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence,\\r\\nand her gratitude for the particular friendship, which together\\r\\nprompted Colonel Brandon to this act, were strongly felt, and warmly\\r\\nexpressed. She thanked him for it with all her heart, spoke of\\r\\nEdward\\'s principles and disposition with that praise which she knew\\r\\nthem to deserve; and promised to undertake the commission with\\r\\npleasure, if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office\\r\\nto another. But at the same time, she could not help thinking that no\\r\\none could so well perform it as himself. It was an office in short,\\r\\nfrom which, unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an\\r\\nobligation from _her_, she would have been very glad to be spared\\r\\nherself; but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy, declining\\r\\nit likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being given through her\\r\\nmeans, that she would not on any account make farther opposition.\\r\\nEdward, she believed, was still in town, and fortunately she had heard\\r\\nhis address from Miss Steele. She could undertake therefore to inform\\r\\nhim of it, in the course of the day. After this had been settled,\\r\\nColonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so\\r\\nrespectable and agreeable a neighbour, and _then_ it was that he\\r\\nmentioned with regret, that the house was small and indifferent; an\\r\\nevil which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do, made very\\r\\nlight of, at least as far as regarded its size.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The smallness of the house,\" said she, \"I cannot imagine any\\r\\ninconvenience to them, for it will be in proportion to their family\\r\\nand income.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy which the Colonel was surprised to find that _she_ was considering\\r\\nMr. Ferrars\\'s marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation;\\r\\nfor he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply\\r\\nsuch an income, as anybody in his style of life would venture to\\r\\nsettle on, and he said so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This little rectory _can_ do no more than make Mr. Ferrars\\r\\ncomfortable as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry. I am sorry\\r\\nto say that my patronage ends with this; and my interest is hardly\\r\\nmore extensive. If, however, by an unforeseen chance it should be in\\r\\nmy power to serve him farther, I must think very differently of him\\r\\nfrom what I now do, if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I\\r\\nsincerely wish I could be at present. What I am now doing indeed,\\r\\nseems nothing at all, since it can advance him so little towards what\\r\\nmust be his principal, his only object of happiness. His marriage must\\r\\nstill be a distant good;--at least, I am afraid it cannot take place\\r\\nvery soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was the sentence which, when misunderstood, so justly offended\\r\\nthe delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings; but after this narration of\\r\\nwhat really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they\\r\\nstood at the window, the gratitude expressed by the latter on their\\r\\nparting, may perhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited,\\r\\nnor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of\\r\\nmarriage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Miss Dashwood,\" said Mrs. Jennings, sagaciously smiling, as\\r\\nsoon as the gentleman had withdrawn, \"I do not ask you what the\\r\\nColonel has been saying to you; for though, upon my honour, I _tried_\\r\\nto keep out of hearing, I could not help catching enough to understand\\r\\nhis business. And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life,\\r\\nand I wish you joy of it with all my heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, ma\\'am,\" said Elinor. \"It is a matter of great joy to me;\\r\\nand I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly. There are\\r\\nnot many men who would act as he has done. Few people who have so\\r\\ncompassionate a heart! I never was more astonished in my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord! my dear, you are very modest. I an\\'t the least astonished at it\\r\\nin the world, for I have often thought of late, there was nothing more\\r\\nlikely to happen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel\\'s general benevolence;\\r\\nbut at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very\\r\\nsoon occur.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Opportunity!\" repeated Mrs. Jennings--\"Oh! as to that, when a man has\\r\\nonce made up his mind to such a thing, somehow or other he will soon\\r\\nfind an opportunity. Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and\\r\\nagain; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think I\\r\\nshall soon know where to look for them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose,\" said Elinor, with a\\r\\nfaint smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed. And as to the house being a bad one,\\r\\nI do not know what the Colonel would be at, for it is as good a one as\\r\\never I saw.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He spoke of its being out of repair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and whose fault is that? why don\\'t he repair it? who should do\\r\\nit but himself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were interrupted by the servant\\'s coming in to announce the\\r\\ncarriage being at the door; and Mrs. Jennings immediately preparing to\\r\\ngo, said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have had half my talk out.\\r\\nBut, however, we may have it all over in the evening; for we shall be\\r\\nquite alone. I do not ask you to go with me, for I dare say your mind\\r\\nis too full of the matter to care for company; and besides, you must\\r\\nlong to tell your sister all about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne had left the room before the conversation began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, ma\\'am, I shall tell Marianne of it; but I shall not\\r\\nmention it at present to any body else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! very well,\" said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed. \"Then you\\r\\nwould not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think of going as far as\\r\\nHolborn to-day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am, not even Lucy if you please. One day\\'s delay will not be\\r\\nvery material; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it\\r\\nought not to be mentioned to any body else. I shall do _that_\\r\\ndirectly. It is of importance that no time should be lost with him,\\r\\nfor he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly. Why Mr.\\r\\nFerrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry, she\\r\\ncould not immediately comprehend. A few moments\\' reflection, however,\\r\\nproduced a very happy idea, and she exclaimed--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, ho! I understand you. Mr. Ferrars is to be the man. Well, so much\\r\\nthe better for him. Ay, to be sure, he must be ordained in readiness;\\r\\nand I am very glad to find things are so forward between you. But, my\\r\\ndear, is not this rather out of character? Should not the Colonel\\r\\nwrite himself? Sure, he is the proper person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\r\\nspeech, neither did she think it worth inquiring into; and therefore\\r\\nonly replied to its conclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather wished any one\\r\\nto announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so _you_ are forced to do it. Well _that_ is an odd kind of\\r\\ndelicacy! However, I will not disturb you (seeing her preparing to\\r\\nwrite.) You know your own concerns best. So good-bye, my dear. I have\\r\\nnot heard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was\\r\\nbrought to bed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd away she went; but returning again in a moment--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have just been thinking of Betty\\'s sister, my dear. I should be\\r\\nvery glad to get her so good a mistress. But whether she would do for\\r\\na lady\\'s maid, I am sure I can\\'t tell. She is an excellent housemaid,\\r\\nand works very well at her needle. However, you will think of all that\\r\\nat your leisure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, ma\\'am,\" replied Elinor, not hearing much of what she said,\\r\\nand more anxious to be alone, than to be mistress of the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow she should begin--how she should express herself in her note to\\r\\nEdward, was now all her concern. The particular circumstances between\\r\\nthem made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have\\r\\nbeen the easiest thing in the world; but she equally feared to say too\\r\\nmuch or too little, and sat deliberating over her paper, with the pen\\r\\nin her hand, till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage, as he\\r\\ncame to leave his farewell card; and she, after apologising for not\\r\\nreturning herself, had obliged him to enter, by saying that Miss\\r\\nDashwood was above, and wanted to speak with him on very particular\\r\\nbusiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor had just been congratulating herself, in the midst of her\\r\\nperplexity, that however difficult it might be to express herself\\r\\nproperly by letter, it was at least preferable to giving the\\r\\ninformation by word of mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her\\r\\nupon this greatest exertion of all. Her astonishment and confusion\\r\\nwere very great on his so sudden appearance. She had not seen him\\r\\nbefore since his engagement became public, and therefore not since his\\r\\nknowing her to be acquainted with it; which, with the consciousness of\\r\\nwhat she had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him, made her\\r\\nfeel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes. He too was much\\r\\ndistressed; and they sat down together in a most promising state of\\r\\nembarrassment. Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on\\r\\nfirst coming into the room, he could not recollect; but determining to\\r\\nbe on the safe side, he made his apology in form as soon as he could\\r\\nsay any thing, after taking a chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Jennings told me,\" said he, \"that you wished to speak with me,\\r\\nat least I understood her so--or I certainly should not have intruded\\r\\non you in such a manner; though at the same time, I should have been\\r\\nextremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;\\r\\nespecially as it will most likely be some time--it is not probable\\r\\nthat I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again. I go to\\r\\nOxford tomorrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You would not have gone, however,\" said Elinor, recovering herself,\\r\\nand determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as\\r\\npossible, \"without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been\\r\\nable to give them in person. Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she\\r\\nsaid. I have something of consequence to inform you of, which I was on\\r\\nthe point of communicating by paper. I am charged with a most\\r\\nagreeable office (breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke.)\\r\\nColonel Brandon, who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to\\r\\nsay, that understanding you mean to take orders, he has great pleasure\\r\\nin offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant, and only\\r\\nwishes it were more valuable. Allow me to congratulate you on having\\r\\nso respectable and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that\\r\\nthe living--it is about two hundred a-year--were much more\\r\\nconsiderable, and such as might better enable you to--as might be more\\r\\nthan a temporary accommodation to yourself--such, in short, as might\\r\\nestablish all your views of happiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Edward felt, as he could not say it himself, it cannot be\\r\\nexpected that any one else should say for him. He _looked_ all the\\r\\nastonishment which such unexpected, such unthought-of information\\r\\ncould not fail of exciting; but he said only these two words--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colonel Brandon!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" continued Elinor, gathering more resolution, as some of the\\r\\nworst was over, \"Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his\\r\\nconcern for what has lately passed--for the cruel situation in which\\r\\nthe unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you--a concern\\r\\nwhich I am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends, must share;\\r\\nand likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character,\\r\\nand his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present\\r\\noccasion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colonel Brandon give _me_ a living!--Can it be possible?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find\\r\\nfriendship any where.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied be, with sudden consciousness, \"not to find it in _you_;\\r\\nfor I cannot be ignorant that to you, to your goodness, I owe it all.\\r\\nI feel it--I would express it if I could--but, as you well know, I am\\r\\nno orator.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very much mistaken. I do assure you that you owe it entirely,\\r\\nat least almost entirely, to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon\\'s\\r\\ndiscernment of it. I have had no hand in it. I did not even know, till\\r\\nI understood his design, that the living was vacant; nor had it ever\\r\\noccurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift. As a\\r\\nfriend of mine, of my family, he may, perhaps--indeed I know he _has_,\\r\\nstill greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word, you owe\\r\\nnothing to my solicitation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTruth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action, but\\r\\nshe was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of\\r\\nEdward, that she acknowledged it with hesitation; which probably\\r\\ncontributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently\\r\\nentered it. For a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor had\\r\\nceased to speak;--at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he\\r\\nsaid--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability. I have\\r\\nalways heard him spoken of as such, and your brother I know esteems\\r\\nhim highly. He is undoubtedly a sensible man, and in his manners\\r\\nperfectly the gentleman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed,\" replied Elinor, \"I believe that you will find him, on\\r\\nfarther acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be, and as you\\r\\nwill be such very near neighbours (for I understand the parsonage is\\r\\nalmost close to the mansion-house,) it is particularly important that\\r\\nhe _should_ be all this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward made no answer; but when she had turned away her head, gave her\\r\\na look so serious, so earnest, so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that\\r\\nhe might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the\\r\\nmansion-house much greater.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James Street,\" said he, soon\\r\\nafterwards, rising from his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor told him the number of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks which you will not\\r\\nallow me to give _you_; to assure him that he has made me a very--an\\r\\nexceedingly happy man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor did not offer to detain him; and they parted, with a very\\r\\nearnest assurance on _her_ side of her unceasing good wishes for his\\r\\nhappiness in every change of situation that might befall him; on\\r\\n_his_, with rather an attempt to return the same good will, than the\\r\\npower of expressing it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I see him again,\" said Elinor to herself, as the door shut him\\r\\nout, \"I shall see him the husband of Lucy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with this pleasing anticipation, she sat down to reconsider the\\r\\npast, recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of\\r\\nEdward; and, of course, to reflect on her own with discontent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned from seeing people\\r\\nwhom she had never seen before, and of whom therefore she must have a\\r\\ngreat deal to say, her mind was so much more occupied by the important\\r\\nsecret in her possession, than by anything else, that she reverted to\\r\\nit again as soon as Elinor appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my dear,\" she cried, \"I sent you up the young man. Did not I do\\r\\nright?--And I suppose you had no great difficulty--You did not find\\r\\nhim very unwilling to accept your proposal?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am; _that_ was not very likely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and how soon will he be ready?--For it seems all to depend upon\\r\\nthat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really,\" said Elinor, \"I know so little of these kind of forms, that\\r\\nI can hardly even conjecture as to the time, or the preparation\\r\\nnecessary; but I suppose two or three months will complete his\\r\\nordination.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two or three months!\" cried Mrs. Jennings; \"Lord! my dear, how calmly\\r\\nyou talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two or three months! Lord\\r\\nbless me!--I am sure it would put _me_ quite out of patience!--And\\r\\nthough one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I\\r\\ndo think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him.\\r\\nSure somebody else might be found that would do as well; somebody that\\r\\nis in orders already.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear ma\\'am,\" said Elinor, \"what can you be thinking of? Why,\\r\\nColonel Brandon\\'s only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord bless you, my dear! Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the\\r\\nColonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr.\\r\\nFerrars!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Both gained considerable amusement_]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deception could not continue after this; and an explanation\\r\\nimmediately took place, by which both gained considerable amusement\\r\\nfor the moment, without any material loss of happiness to either, for\\r\\nMrs. Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another, and\\r\\nstill without forfeiting her expectation of the first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one,\" said she, after the\\r\\nfirst ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over, \"and very\\r\\nlikely _may_ be out of repair; but to hear a man apologising, as I\\r\\nthought, for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on\\r\\nthe ground-floor, and I think the housekeeper told me could make up\\r\\nfifteen beds! and to you too, that had been used to live in Barton\\r\\ncottage! It seems quite ridiculous. But, my dear, we must touch up the\\r\\nColonel to do some thing to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for\\r\\nthem, before Lucy goes to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living\\'s\\r\\nbeing enough to allow them to marry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two thousand a-year\\r\\nhimself, he thinks that nobody else can marry on less. Take my word\\r\\nfor it, that, if I am alive, I shall be paying a visit at Delaford\\r\\nParsonage before Michaelmas; and I am sure I shan\\'t go if Lucy an\\'t\\r\\nthere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor was quite of her opinion, as to the probability of their not\\r\\nwaiting for any thing more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward, having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon, proceeded with\\r\\nhis happiness to Lucy; and such was the excess of it by the time he\\r\\nreached Bartlett\\'s Buildings, that she was able to assure Mrs.\\r\\nJennings, who called on her again the next day with her\\r\\ncongratulations, that she had never seen him in such spirits before in\\r\\nher life.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer own happiness, and her own spirits, were at least very certain;\\r\\nand she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their\\r\\nbeing all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before\\r\\nMichaelmas. So far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness to\\r\\ngive Elinor that credit which Edward _would_ give her, that she spoke\\r\\nof her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth, was\\r\\nready to own all their obligation to her, and openly declared that no\\r\\nexertion for their good on Miss Dashwood\\'s part, either present or\\r\\nfuture, would ever surprise her, for she believed her capable of doing\\r\\nany thing in the world for those she really valued. As for Colonel\\r\\nBrandon, she was not only ready to worship him as a saint, but was\\r\\nmoreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly\\r\\nconcerns; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost; and\\r\\nscarcely resolved to avail herself, at Delaford, as far as she\\r\\npossibly could, of his servants, his carriage, his cows, and his\\r\\npoultry.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley\\r\\nStreet, and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his\\r\\nwife\\'s indisposition, beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel\\r\\nit necessary to pay her a visit. This was an obligation, however,\\r\\nwhich not only opposed her own inclination, but which had not the\\r\\nassistance of any encouragement from her companions. Marianne, not\\r\\ncontented with absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent to\\r\\nprevent her sister\\'s going at all; and Mrs. Jennings, though her\\r\\ncarriage was always at Elinor\\'s service, so very much disliked Mrs.\\r\\nJohn Dashwood, that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after\\r\\nthe late discovery, nor her strong desire to affront her by taking\\r\\nEdward\\'s part, could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company\\r\\nagain. The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay a\\r\\nvisit, for which no one could really have less inclination, and to run\\r\\nthe risk of a tete-a-tete with a woman, whom neither of the others had\\r\\nso much reason to dislike.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could turn from the\\r\\nhouse, her husband accidentally came out. He expressed great pleasure\\r\\nin meeting Elinor, told her that he had been just going to call in\\r\\nBerkeley Street, and, assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to\\r\\nsee her, invited her to come in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked up stairs in to the drawing-room. Nobody was there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fanny is in her own room, I suppose,\" said he:--\"I will go to her\\r\\npresently, for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the\\r\\nworld to seeing _you._ Very far from it, indeed. _Now_ especially\\r\\nthere cannot be--but however, you and Marianne were always great\\r\\nfavourites. Why would not Marianne come?\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor made what excuse she could for her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not sorry to see you alone,\" he replied, \"for I have a good deal\\r\\nto say to you. This living of Colonel Brandon\\'s--can it be true?--has\\r\\nhe really given it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance, and was\\r\\ncoming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is perfectly true. Colonel Brandon has given the living of\\r\\nDelaford to Edward.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really!--Well, this is very astonishing!--no relationship!--no\\r\\nconnection between them!--and now that livings fetch such a\\r\\nprice!--what was the value of this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About two hundred a year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well--and for the next presentation to a living of that\\r\\nvalue--supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly, and\\r\\nlikely to vacate it soon--he might have got I dare say--fourteen\\r\\nhundred pounds. And how came he not to have settled that matter before\\r\\nthis person\\'s death? _Now_ indeed it would be too late to sell it, but\\r\\na man of Colonel Brandon\\'s sense!--I wonder he should be so\\r\\nimprovident in a point of such common, such natural, concern!--Well, I\\r\\nam convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost\\r\\nevery human character. I suppose, however--on recollection--that the\\r\\ncase may probably be _this._ Edward is only to hold the living till\\r\\nthe person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is\\r\\nold enough to take it. Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor contradicted it, however, very positively; and by relating that\\r\\nshe had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel\\r\\nBrandon to Edward, and, therefore, must understand the terms on which\\r\\nit was given, obliged him to submit to her authority.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is truly astonishing!\"--he cried, after hearing what she\\r\\nsaid--\"what could be the Colonel\\'s motive?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A very simple one--to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward is a very lucky\\r\\nman. You will not mention the matter to Fanny, however, for though I\\r\\nhave broke it to her, and she bears it vastly well,--she will not like\\r\\nto hear it much talked of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing, that she\\r\\nthought Fanny might have borne with composure, an acquisition of\\r\\nwealth to her brother, by which neither she nor her child could be\\r\\npossibly impoverished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Ferrars,\" added he, lowering his voice to the tone becoming so\\r\\nimportant a subject, \"knows nothing about it at present, and I believe\\r\\nit will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may\\r\\nbe. When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear of it all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why should such precaution be used? Though it is not to be\\r\\nsupposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in\\r\\nknowing that her son has money enough to live upon,--for _that_ must\\r\\nbe quite out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour, is she\\r\\nsupposed to feel at all? She has done with her son, she cast him off\\r\\nfor ever, and has made all those over whom she had any influence, cast\\r\\nhim off likewise. Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined\\r\\nliable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account--she\\r\\ncannot be interested in any thing that befalls him. She would not be\\r\\nso weak as to throw away the comfort of a child, and yet retain the\\r\\nanxiety of a parent!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! Elinor,\" said John, \"your reasoning is very good, but it is\\r\\nfounded on ignorance of human nature. When Edward\\'s unhappy match\\r\\ntakes place, depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had\\r\\nnever discarded him; and, therefore every circumstance that may\\r\\naccelerate that dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as\\r\\npossible. Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You surprise me; I should think it must nearly have escaped her\\r\\nmemory by _this_ time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You wrong her exceedingly. Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most\\r\\naffectionate mothers in the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We think _now_,\"--said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause, \"of\\r\\n_Robert\\'s_ marrying Miss Morton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother\\'s\\r\\ntone, calmly replied--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Choice!--how do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I only mean that I suppose, from your manner of speaking, it must be\\r\\nthe same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert will now to all\\r\\nintents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;--and as to any\\r\\nthing else, they are both very agreeable young men: I do not know that\\r\\none is superior to the other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor said no more, and John was also for a short time silent. His\\r\\nreflections ended thus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of _one_ thing, my dear sister,\" kindly taking her hand, and speaking\\r\\nin an awful whisper,--\"I may assure you; and I _will_ do it, because I\\r\\nknow it must gratify you. I have good reason to think--indeed I have\\r\\nit from the best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise\\r\\nit would be very wrong to say any thing about it,--but I have it from\\r\\nthe very best authority,--not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars\\r\\nsay it herself--but her daughter _did_, and I have it from her,--that\\r\\nin short, whatever objections there might be against a certain--a\\r\\ncertain connection, you understand me,--it would have been far\\r\\npreferable to her, it would not have given her half the vexation that\\r\\n_this_ does. I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars\\r\\nconsidered it in that light; a very gratifying circumstance you know\\r\\nto us all. \\'It would have been beyond comparison,\\' she said, \\'the\\r\\nleast evil of the two, and she would be glad to compound _now_ for\\r\\nnothing worse.\\' But however, all that is quite out of the\\r\\nquestion,--not to be thought of or mentioned. As to any attachment you\\r\\nknow, it never could be; all that is gone by. But I thought I would\\r\\njust tell you of this, because I knew how much it must please you. Not\\r\\nthat you have any reason to regret, my dear Elinor. There is no doubt\\r\\nof your doing exceedingly well,--quite as well, or better, perhaps,\\r\\nall things considered. Has Colonel Brandon been with you lately?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity, and raise her\\r\\nself-importance, to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;--and she was\\r\\ntherefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply\\r\\nherself, and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her\\r\\nbrother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars. After a few moments\\'\\r\\nchat, John Dashwood, recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her\\r\\nsister\\'s being there, quitted the room in quest of her; and Elinor was\\r\\nleft to improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the gay\\r\\nunconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner while enjoying so\\r\\nunfair a division of his mother\\'s love and liberality, to the\\r\\nprejudice of his banished brother, earned only by his own dissipated\\r\\ncourse of life, and that brother\\'s integrity, was confirming her most\\r\\nunfavourable opinion of his head and heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: \"_Of one thing I may assure you._\"]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had scarcely been two minutes by themselves, before he began to\\r\\nspeak of Edward; for he, too, had heard of the living, and was very\\r\\ninquisitive on the subject. Elinor repeated the particulars of it, as\\r\\nshe had given them to John; and their effect on Robert, though very\\r\\ndifferent, was not less striking than it had been on _him._ He laughed\\r\\nmost immoderately. The idea of Edward\\'s being a clergyman, and living\\r\\nin a small parsonage-house, diverted him beyond measure;--and when to\\r\\nthat was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a\\r\\nwhite surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John\\r\\nSmith and Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor, while she waited in silence and immovable gravity, the\\r\\nconclusion of such folly, could not restrain her eyes from being fixed\\r\\non him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited. It was a\\r\\nlook, however, very well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings,\\r\\nand gave no intelligence to him. He was recalled from wit to wisdom,\\r\\nnot by any reproof of her\\'s, but by his own sensibility.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We may treat it as a joke,\" said he, at last, recovering from the\\r\\naffected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine\\r\\ngaiety of the moment; \"but, upon my soul, it is a most serious\\r\\nbusiness. Poor Edward! he is ruined for ever. I am extremely sorry for\\r\\nit; for I know him to be a very good-hearted creature,--as\\r\\nwell-meaning a fellow perhaps, as any in the world. You must not judge\\r\\nof him, Miss Dashwood, from _your_ slight acquaintance. Poor Edward!\\r\\nHis manners are certainly not the happiest in nature. But we are not\\r\\nall born, you know, with the same powers,--the same address. Poor\\r\\nfellow! to see him in a circle of strangers! to be sure it was\\r\\npitiable enough; but upon my soul, I believe he has as good a heart as\\r\\nany in the kingdom; and I declare and protest to you I never was so\\r\\nshocked in my life, as when it all burst forth. I could not believe\\r\\nit. My mother was the first person who told me of it; and I, feeling\\r\\nmyself called on to act with resolution, immediately said to her,--\\'My\\r\\ndear madam, I do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion,\\r\\nbut as for myself, I must say, that if Edward does marry this young\\r\\nwoman, I never will see him again.\\' That was what I said immediately.\\r\\nI was most uncommonly shocked, indeed! Poor Edward! he has done for\\r\\nhimself completely,--shut himself out for ever from all decent\\r\\nsociety! but, as I directly said to my mother, I am not in the least\\r\\nsurprised at it; from his style of education, it was always to be\\r\\nexpected. My poor mother was half frantic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you ever seen the lady?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; once, while she was staying in this house, I happened to drop in\\r\\nfor ten minutes; and I saw quite enough of her. The merest awkward\\r\\ncountry girl, without style, or elegance, and almost without beauty. I\\r\\nremember her perfectly. Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely\\r\\nto captivate poor Edward. I offered immediately, as soon as my mother\\r\\nrelated the affair to me, to talk to him myself, and dissuade him from\\r\\nthe match; but it was too late _then_, I found, to do any thing, for\\r\\nunluckily, I was not in the way at first, and knew nothing of it till\\r\\nafter the breach had taken place, when it was not for me, you know, to\\r\\ninterfere. But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier, I think\\r\\nit is most probable that something might have been hit on. I certainly\\r\\nshould have represented it to Edward in a very strong light. \\'My dear\\r\\nfellow,\\' I should have said, \\'consider what you are doing. You are\\r\\nmaking a most disgraceful connection, and such a one as your family\\r\\nare unanimous in disapproving.\\' I cannot help thinking, in short, that\\r\\nmeans might have been found. But now it is all too late. He must be\\r\\nstarved, you know, that is certain; absolutely starved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had just settled this point with great composure, when the entrance\\r\\nof Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject. But though _she_\\r\\nnever spoke of it out of her own family, Elinor could see its\\r\\ninfluence on her mind, in the something like confusion of countenance\\r\\nwith which she entered, and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour\\r\\nto herself. She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that\\r\\nElinor and her sister were so soon to leave town, as she had hoped to\\r\\nsee more of them;--an exertion in which her husband, who attended her\\r\\ninto the room, and hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to\\r\\ndistinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne other short call in Harley Street, in which Elinor received her\\r\\nbrother\\'s congratulations on their travelling so far towards Barton\\r\\nwithout any expense, and on Colonel Brandon\\'s being to follow them to\\r\\nCleveland in a day or two, completed the intercourse of the brother\\r\\nand sisters in town;--and a faint invitation from Fanny, to come to\\r\\nNorland whenever it should happen to be in their way, which of all\\r\\nthings was the most unlikely to occur, with a more warm, though less\\r\\npublic, assurance, from John to Elinor, of the promptitude with which\\r\\nhe should come to see her at Delaford, was all that foretold any\\r\\nmeeting in the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to\\r\\nsend her to Delaford;--a place, in which, of all others, she would now\\r\\nleast choose to visit, or wish to reside; for not only was it\\r\\nconsidered as her future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings, but\\r\\neven Lucy, when they parted, gave her a pressing invitation to visit\\r\\nher there.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery early in April, and tolerably early in the day, the two parties\\r\\nfrom Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set out from their respective\\r\\nhomes, to meet, by appointment, on the road. For the convenience of\\r\\nCharlotte and her child, they were to be more than two days on their\\r\\njourney, and Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously with Colonel\\r\\nBrandon, was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne, few as had been her hours of comfort in London, and eager as\\r\\nshe had long been to quit it, could not, when it came to the point,\\r\\nbid adieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed\\r\\nthose hopes, and that confidence, in Willoughby, which were now\\r\\nextinguished for ever, without great pain. Nor could she leave the\\r\\nplace in which Willoughby remained, busy in new engagements, and new\\r\\nschemes, in which _she_ could have no share, without shedding many\\r\\ntears.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor\\'s satisfaction, at the moment of removal, was more positive.\\r\\nShe had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on, she left\\r\\nno creature behind, from whom it would give her a moment\\'s regret to\\r\\nbe divided for ever, she was pleased to be free herself from the\\r\\npersecution of Lucy\\'s friendship, she was grateful for bringing her\\r\\nsister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage, and she looked\\r\\nforward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might\\r\\ndo towards restoring Marianne\\'s peace of mind, and confirming her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir journey was safely performed. The second day brought them into\\r\\nthe cherished, or the prohibited, county of Somerset, for as such was\\r\\nit dwelt on by turns in Marianne\\'s imagination; and in the forenoon of\\r\\nthe third they drove up to Cleveland.\\r\\n\\r\\nCleveland was a spacious, modern-built house, situated on a sloping\\r\\nlawn. It had no park, but the pleasure-grounds were tolerably\\r\\nextensive; and like every other place of the same degree of\\r\\nimportance, it had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk, a road of\\r\\nsmooth gravel winding round a plantation, led to the front, the lawn\\r\\nwas dotted over with timber, the house itself was under the\\r\\nguardianship of the fir, the mountain-ash, and the acacia, and a thick\\r\\nscreen of them altogether, interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars,\\r\\nshut out the offices.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the\\r\\nconsciousness of being only eighty miles from Barton, and not thirty\\r\\nfrom Combe Magna; and before she had been five minutes within its\\r\\nwalls, while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show her\\r\\nchild to the housekeeper, she quitted it again, stealing away through\\r\\nthe winding shrubberies, now just beginning to be in beauty, to gain a\\r\\ndistant eminence; where, from its Grecian temple, her eye, wandering\\r\\nover a wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly rest on\\r\\nthe farthest ridge of hills in the horizon, and fancy that from their\\r\\nsummits Combe Magna might be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn such moments of precious, invaluable misery, she rejoiced in tears\\r\\nof agony to be at Cleveland; and as she returned by a different\\r\\ncircuit to the house, feeling all the happy privilege of country\\r\\nliberty, of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious\\r\\nsolitude, she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while\\r\\nshe remained with the Palmers, in the indulgence of such solitary\\r\\nrambles.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Showing her child to the housekeeper._]\\r\\n\\r\\nShe returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the\\r\\nhouse, on an excursion through its more immediate premises; and the\\r\\nrest of the morning was easily whiled away, in lounging round the\\r\\nkitchen garden, examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to\\r\\nthe gardener\\'s lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through the\\r\\ngreen-house, where the loss of her favourite plants, unwarily exposed,\\r\\nand nipped by the lingering frost, raised the laughter of\\r\\nCharlotte,--and in visiting her poultry-yard, where, in the\\r\\ndisappointed hopes of her dairy-maid, by hens forsaking their nests,\\r\\nor being stolen by a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising\\r\\nyoung brood, she found fresh sources of merriment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning was fine and dry, and Marianne, in her plan of employment\\r\\nabroad, had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay\\r\\nat Cleveland. With great surprise therefore, did she find herself\\r\\nprevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner. She had\\r\\ndepended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple, and perhaps all\\r\\nover the grounds, and an evening merely cold or damp would not have\\r\\ndeterred her from it; but a heavy and settled rain even _she_ could\\r\\nnot fancy dry or pleasant weather for walking.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir party was small, and the hours passed quietly away. Mrs. Palmer\\r\\nhad her child, and Mrs. Jennings her carpet-work; they talked of the\\r\\nfriends they had left behind, arranged Lady Middleton\\'s engagements,\\r\\nand wondered whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther\\r\\nthan Reading that night. Elinor, however little concerned in it,\\r\\njoined in their discourse; and Marianne, who had the knack of finding\\r\\nher way in every house to the library, however it might be avoided by\\r\\nthe family in general, soon procured herself a book.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer\\'s side that constant and friendly\\r\\ngood humour could do, to make them feel themselves welcome. The\\r\\nopenness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want\\r\\nof recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the\\r\\nforms of politeness; her kindness, recommended by so pretty a face,\\r\\nwas engaging; her folly, though evident was not disgusting, because it\\r\\nwas not conceited; and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her\\r\\nlaugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _The gardener\\'s lamentations._]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner,\\r\\naffording a pleasant enlargement of the party, and a very welcome\\r\\nvariety to their conversation, which a long morning of the same\\r\\ncontinued rain had reduced very low.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that little had seen\\r\\nso much variety in his address to her sister and herself, that she\\r\\nknew not what to expect to find him in his own family. She found him,\\r\\nhowever, perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors,\\r\\nand only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother; she found him\\r\\nvery capable of being a pleasant companion, and only prevented from\\r\\nbeing so always, by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much\\r\\nsuperior to people in general, as he must feel himself to be to Mrs.\\r\\nJennings and Charlotte. For the rest of his character and habits, they\\r\\nwere marked, as far as Elinor could perceive, with no traits at all\\r\\nunusual in his sex and time of life. He was nice in his eating,\\r\\nuncertain in his hours; fond of his child, though affecting to slight\\r\\nit; and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought to have been\\r\\ndevoted to business. She liked him, however, upon the whole, much\\r\\nbetter than she had expected, and in her heart was not sorry that she\\r\\ncould like him no more; not sorry to be driven by the observation of\\r\\nhis epicurism, his selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with\\r\\ncomplacency on the remembrance of Edward\\'s generous temper, simple\\r\\ntaste, and diffident feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf Edward, or at least of some of his concerns, she now received\\r\\nintelligence from Colonel Brandon, who had been into Dorsetshire\\r\\nlately; and who, treating her at once as the disinterested friend of\\r\\nMr. Ferrars, and the kind confidante of himself, talked to her a\\r\\ngreat deal of the parsonage at Delaford, described its deficiencies,\\r\\nand told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them. His\\r\\nbehaviour to her in this, as well as in every other particular, his\\r\\nopen pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days, his\\r\\nreadiness to converse with her, and his deference for her opinion,\\r\\nmight very well justify Mrs. Jennings\\'s persuasion of his attachment,\\r\\nand would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still, as from the\\r\\nfirst, believed Marianne his real favourite, to make her suspect it\\r\\nherself. But as it was, such a notion had scarcely ever entered her\\r\\nhead, except by Mrs. Jennings\\'s suggestion; and she could not help\\r\\nbelieving herself the nicest observer of the two: she watched his\\r\\neyes, while Mrs. Jennings thought only of his behaviour; and while his\\r\\nlooks of anxious solicitude on Marianne\\'s feeling, in her head and\\r\\nthroat, the beginning of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words,\\r\\nentirely escaped the latter lady\\'s observation,--_she_ could discover\\r\\nin them the quick feelings, and needless alarm of a lover.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo delightful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her\\r\\nbeing there, not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery, but all\\r\\nover the grounds, and especially in the most distant parts of them,\\r\\nwhere there was something more of wildness than in the rest, where the\\r\\ntrees were the oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest,\\r\\nhad--assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet\\r\\nshoes and stockings--given Marianne a cold so violent as, though for a\\r\\nday or two trifled with or denied, would force itself by increasing\\r\\nailments on the concern of every body, and the notice of herself.\\r\\nPrescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual, were all\\r\\ndeclined. Though heavy and feverish, with a pain in her limbs, and a\\r\\ncough, and a sore throat, a good night\\'s rest was to cure her\\r\\nentirely; and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her,\\r\\nwhen she went to bed, to try one or two of the simplest of the\\r\\nremedies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne got up the next morning at her usual time; to every inquiry\\r\\nreplied that she was better, and tried to prove herself so, by\\r\\nengaging in her accustomary employments. But a day spent in sitting\\r\\nshivering over the fire with a book in her hand, which she was unable\\r\\nto read, or in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak much\\r\\nin favour of her amendment; and when, at last, she went early to bed,\\r\\nmore and more indisposed, Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her\\r\\nsister\\'s composure, who, though attending and nursing her the whole\\r\\nday, against Marianne\\'s inclination, and forcing proper medicines on\\r\\nher at night, trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty and efficacy of\\r\\nsleep, and felt no real alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nA very restless and feverish night, however, disappointed the\\r\\nexpectation of both; and when Marianne, after persisting in rising,\\r\\nconfessed herself unable to sit up, and returned voluntarily to her\\r\\nbed, Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings\\'s advice, of sending\\r\\nfor the Palmers\\' apothecary.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came, examined his patient, and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to\\r\\nexpect that a very few days would restore her sister to health, yet,\\r\\nby pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency, and allowing\\r\\nthe word \"infection\" to pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs.\\r\\nPalmer, on her baby\\'s account. Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined\\r\\nfrom the first to think Marianne\\'s complaint more serious than Elinor,\\r\\nnow looked very grave on Mr. Harris\\'s report, and confirming\\r\\nCharlotte\\'s fears and caution, urged the necessity of her immediate\\r\\nremoval with her infant; and Mr. Palmer, though treating their\\r\\napprehensions as idle, found the anxiety and importunity of his wife\\r\\ntoo great to be withstood. Her departure, therefore, was fixed on; and\\r\\nwithin an hour after Mr. Harris\\'s arrival, she set off, with her\\r\\nlittle boy and his nurse, for the house of a near relation of Mr.\\r\\nPalmer\\'s, who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath; whither her\\r\\nhusband promised, at her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or\\r\\ntwo; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to\\r\\naccompany her. Mrs. Jennings, however, with a kindness of heart which\\r\\nmade Elinor really love her, declared her resolution of not stirring\\r\\nfrom Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring,\\r\\nby her own attentive care, to supply to her the place of the mother\\r\\nshe had taken her from; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most\\r\\nwilling and active helpmate, desirous to share in all her fatigues,\\r\\nand often by her better experience in nursing, of material use.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Marianne, languid and low from the nature of her malady, and\\r\\nfeeling herself universally ill, could no longer hope that tomorrow\\r\\nwould find her recovered; and the idea of what tomorrow would have\\r\\nproduced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe; for\\r\\non that day they were to have begun their journey home; and, attended\\r\\nthe whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, were to have taken their\\r\\nmother by surprise on the following forenoon. The little she said was\\r\\nall in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried to\\r\\nraise her spirits, and make her believe, as she _then_ really believed\\r\\nherself, that it would be a very short one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the\\r\\npatient; she certainly was not better, and, except that there was no\\r\\namendment, did not appear worse. Their party was now farther reduced;\\r\\nfor Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity\\r\\nand good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away\\r\\nby his wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his\\r\\npromise of following her; and while he was preparing to go, Colonel\\r\\nBrandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going\\r\\nlikewise. Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most\\r\\nacceptably; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much\\r\\nuneasiness on her sister\\'s account, would be to deprive them both, she\\r\\nthought, of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once that his\\r\\nstay at Cleveland was necessary to herself, that she should want him\\r\\nto play at piquet of an evening, while Miss Dashwood was above with\\r\\nher sister, &c. she urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was\\r\\ngratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not\\r\\nlong even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings\\'s entreaty was\\r\\nwarmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed to feel a relief to himself,\\r\\nin leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss\\r\\nDashwood in any emergence.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all these arrangements.\\r\\nShe knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of\\r\\nCleveland away, in about seven days from the time of their arrival. It\\r\\ngave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer; and as it\\r\\ngave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned her name.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer\\'s departure, and her\\r\\nsituation continued, with little variation, the same. Mr. Harris, who\\r\\nattended her every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and\\r\\nMiss Dashwood was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others\\r\\nwas by no means so cheerful. Mrs. Jennings had determined very early\\r\\nin the seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and Colonel\\r\\nBrandon, who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\r\\nforebodings, was not in a state of mind to resist their influence. He\\r\\ntried to reason himself out of fears, which the different judgment of\\r\\nthe apothecary seemed to render absurd; but the many hours of each day\\r\\nin which he was left entirely alone, were but too favourable for the\\r\\nadmission of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from his\\r\\nmind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the morning of the third day however, the gloomy anticipations of\\r\\nboth were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he declared\\r\\nhis patient materially better. Her pulse was much stronger, and every\\r\\nsymptom more favourable than on the preceding visit. Elinor, confirmed\\r\\nin every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in her\\r\\nletters to her mother, she had pursued her own judgment rather than\\r\\nher friend\\'s, in making very light of the indisposition which delayed\\r\\nthem at Cleveland; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would\\r\\nbe able to travel.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the day did not close so auspiciously as it began. Towards the\\r\\nevening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, and\\r\\nuncomfortable than before. Her sister, however, still sanguine, was\\r\\nwilling to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of\\r\\nhaving sat up to have her bed made; and carefully administering the\\r\\ncordials prescribed, saw her, with satisfaction, sink at last into a\\r\\nslumber, from which she expected the most beneficial effects. Her\\r\\nsleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted a\\r\\nconsiderable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself,\\r\\nshe resolved to sit with her during the whole of it. Mrs. Jennings,\\r\\nknowing nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to\\r\\nbed; her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating\\r\\nherself in the housekeeper\\'s room, and Elinor remained alone with\\r\\nMarianne.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe repose of the latter became more and more disturbed; and her\\r\\nsister, who watched, with unremitting attention her continual change\\r\\nof posture, and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of\\r\\ncomplaint which passed her lips, was almost wishing to rouse her from\\r\\nso painful a slumber, when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some\\r\\naccidental noise in the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish\\r\\nwildness, cried out,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is mama coming?--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not yet,\" cried the other, concealing her terror, and assisting\\r\\nMarianne to lie down again, \"but she will be here, I hope, before it\\r\\nis long. It is a great way, you know, from hence to Barton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But she must not go round by London,\" cried Marianne, in the same\\r\\nhurried manner. \"I shall never see her, if she goes by London.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself, and, while\\r\\nattempting to soothe her, eagerly felt her pulse. It was lower and\\r\\nquicker than ever! and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her\\r\\nalarm increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending instantly\\r\\nfor Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother.\\r\\nTo consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the\\r\\nlatter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its\\r\\nperformance; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by\\r\\nher sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room, where she knew he\\r\\nwas generally to be found at a much later hour than the present.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was no time for hesitation. Her fears and her difficulties were\\r\\nimmediately before him. Her fears, he had no courage, no confidence to\\r\\nattempt the removal of; he listened to them in silent despondence; but\\r\\nher difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness that\\r\\nseemed to speak the occasion, and the service pre-arranged in his\\r\\nmind, he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs.\\r\\nDashwood. Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome. She\\r\\nthanked him with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went to\\r\\nhurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and an order for\\r\\npost-horses directly, she wrote a few lines to her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon--or\\r\\nsuch a companion for her mother,--how gratefully was it felt!--a\\r\\ncompanion whose judgment would guide, whose attendance must relieve,\\r\\nand whose friendship might soothe her!--as far as the shock of such a\\r\\nsummons _could_ be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his\\r\\nassistance, would lessen it.\\r\\n\\r\\n_He_, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all the firmness\\r\\nof a collected mind, made every necessary arrangement with the utmost\\r\\ndespatch, and calculated with exactness the time in which she might\\r\\nlook for his return. Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind. The\\r\\nhorses arrived, even before they were expected, and Colonel Brandon\\r\\nonly pressing her hand with a look of solemnity, and a few words\\r\\nspoken too low to reach her ear, hurried into the carriage. It was\\r\\nthen about twelve o\\'clock, and she returned to her sister\\'s apartment\\r\\nto wait for the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her the\\r\\nrest of the night. It was a night of almost equal suffering to both.\\r\\nHour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on\\r\\nMarianne\\'s side, and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor\\'s, before Mr.\\r\\nHarris appeared. Her apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess\\r\\nfor all her former security; and the servant who sat up with her, for\\r\\nshe would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her\\r\\nmore, by hints of what her mistress had always thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne\\'s ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her\\r\\nmother, and whenever she mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the\\r\\nheart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with\\r\\nso many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief,\\r\\nfancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had\\r\\nbeen delayed too long, and pictured to herself her suffering mother\\r\\narriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if _he_ could\\r\\nnot come, for some other advice, when the former--but not till after\\r\\nfive o\\'clock--arrived. His opinion, however, made some little amends\\r\\nfor his delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and\\r\\nunpleasant alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger to\\r\\nbe material, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment\\r\\nmust procure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, was\\r\\ncommunicated to Elinor. He promised to call again in the course of\\r\\nthree or four hours, and left both the patient and her anxious\\r\\nattendant more composed than he had found them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith strong concern, and with many reproaches for not being called to\\r\\ntheir aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed.\\r\\nHer former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her\\r\\nno doubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor,\\r\\nher conviction of her sister\\'s danger would not allow her to offer the\\r\\ncomfort of hope. Her heart was really grieved. The rapid decay, the\\r\\nearly death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have\\r\\nstruck a less interested person with concern. On Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\r\\ncompassion she had other claims. She had been for three months her\\r\\ncompanion, was still under her care, and she was known to have been\\r\\ngreatly injured, and long unhappy. The distress of her sister too,\\r\\nparticularly a favourite, was before her;--and as for their mother,\\r\\nwhen Mrs. Jennings considered that Marianne might probably be to _her_\\r\\nwhat Charlotte was to herself, her sympathy in _her_ sufferings was\\r\\nvery sincere.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Harris was punctual in his second visit; but he came to be\\r\\ndisappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce. His\\r\\nmedicines had failed; the fever was unabated; and Marianne only more\\r\\nquiet--not more herself--remained in a heavy stupor. Elinor, catching\\r\\nall, and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call in\\r\\nfurther advice. But he judged it unnecessary: he had still something\\r\\nmore to try, some more fresh application, of whose success he was as\\r\\nconfident as the last, and his visit concluded with encouraging\\r\\nassurances which reached the ear, but could not enter the heart of\\r\\nMiss Dashwood. She was calm, except when she thought of her mother;\\r\\nbut she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued till\\r\\nnoon, scarcely stirring from her sister\\'s bed, her thoughts wandering\\r\\nfrom one image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her\\r\\nspirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings,\\r\\nwho scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack\\r\\nto the many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne\\'s\\r\\ndisappointment had brought on. Elinor felt all the reasonableness of\\r\\nthe idea, and it gave fresh misery to her reflections.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a dread of\\r\\ndisappointment which for some time kept her silent, even to her\\r\\nfriend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her\\r\\nsister\\'s pulse; she waited, watched, and examined it again and again;\\r\\nand at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior\\r\\ncalmness, than all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate her\\r\\nhopes. Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination, to acknowledge a\\r\\ntemporary revival, tried to keep her young friend from indulging a\\r\\nthought of its continuance; and Elinor, conning over every injunction\\r\\nof distrust, told herself likewise not to hope. But it was too late.\\r\\nHope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter, she\\r\\nbent over her sister to watch--she hardly knew for what. Half an hour\\r\\npassed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her. Others even\\r\\narose to confirm it. Her breath, her skin, her lips, all flattered\\r\\nElinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on her\\r\\nwith a rational, though languid, gaze. Anxiety and hope now oppressed\\r\\nher in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity till the\\r\\narrival of Mr. Harris at four o\\'clock; when his assurances, his\\r\\nfelicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his\\r\\nexpectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne was in every respect materially better, and he declared her\\r\\nentirely out of danger. Mrs. Jennings, perhaps satisfied with the\\r\\npartial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their\\r\\nlate alarm, allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,\\r\\nwith unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, the\\r\\nprobability of an entire recovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor could not be cheerful. Her joy was of a different kind, and led\\r\\nto any thing rather than to gaiety. Marianne restored to life, health,\\r\\nfriends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with\\r\\nsensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent\\r\\ngratitude;--but it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,\\r\\nno smiles. All within Elinor\\'s breast was satisfaction, silent and\\r\\nstrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe continued by the side of her sister, with little intermission the\\r\\nwhole afternoon, calming every fear, satisfying every inquiry of her\\r\\nenfeebled spirits, supplying every succour, and watching almost every\\r\\nlook and every breath. The possibility of a relapse would of course,\\r\\nin some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was; but when she\\r\\nsaw, on her frequent and minute examination, that every symptom of\\r\\nrecovery continued, and saw Marianne at six o\\'clock sink into a quiet,\\r\\nsteady, and to all appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every\\r\\ndoubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon might be expected\\r\\nback. At ten o\\'clock, she trusted, or at least not much later her\\r\\nmother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must\\r\\nnow be travelling towards them. The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely\\r\\nless an object of pity! Oh! how slow was the progress of time which\\r\\nyet kept them in ignorance!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt seven o\\'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she joined\\r\\nMrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea. Of breakfast she had been\\r\\nkept by her fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating\\r\\nmuch; and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of\\r\\ncontent as she brought to it, was particularly welcome. Mrs. Jennings\\r\\nwould have persuaded her, at its conclusion, to take some rest before\\r\\nher mother\\'s arrival, and allow _her_ to take her place by Marianne;\\r\\nbut Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that\\r\\nmoment about her, and she was not to be kept away from her sister an\\r\\nunnecessary instant. Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs\\r\\ninto the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,\\r\\nleft her there again to her charge and her thoughts, and retired to\\r\\nher own room to write letters and sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night was cold and stormy. The wind roared round the house, and\\r\\nthe rain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within,\\r\\nregarded it not. Marianne slept through every blast; and the\\r\\ntravellers, they had a rich reward in store, for every present\\r\\ninconvenience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clock struck eight. Had it been ten, Elinor would have been\\r\\nconvinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the\\r\\nhouse; and so strong was the persuasion that she _did_, in spite of\\r\\nthe _almost_ impossibility of their being already come, that she moved\\r\\ninto the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter, to be\\r\\nsatisfied of the truth. She instantly saw that her ears had not\\r\\ndeceived her. The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in\\r\\nview. By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be\\r\\ndrawn by four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her poor\\r\\nmother\\'s alarm, gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm, as at\\r\\nthat moment. The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the\\r\\ncarriage stopped the door,--of her doubt--her dread,--perhaps her\\r\\ndespair!--and of what _she_ had to tell! with such knowledge it was\\r\\nimpossible to be calm. All that remained to be done was to be speedy;\\r\\nand, therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings\\'s maid\\r\\nwith her sister, she hurried down stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along an inner lobby,\\r\\nassured her that they were already in the house. She rushed to the\\r\\ndrawing-room,--she entered it,--and saw only Willoughby.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Opened a window-shutter._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLIV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor, starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him,\\r\\nobeyed the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the\\r\\nroom, and her hand was already on the lock, when its action was\\r\\nsuspended by his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather of\\r\\ncommand than supplication--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Dashwood, for half an hour--for ten minutes--I entreat you to\\r\\nstay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir,\" she replied with firmness, \"I shall _not_ stay. Your\\r\\nbusiness cannot be with _me._ The servants, I suppose, forgot to tell\\r\\nyou that Mr. Palmer was not in the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had they told me,\" he cried with vehemence, \"that Mr. Palmer and all\\r\\nhis relations were at the devil, it would not have turned me from the\\r\\ndoor. My business is with you, and only you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With me!\"--in the utmost amazement;--\"well, sir--be quick--and if you\\r\\ncan--less violent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sit down, and I will be both.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated; she knew not what to do. The possibility of Colonel\\r\\nBrandon\\'s arriving and finding her there, came across her. But she had\\r\\npromised to hear him, and her curiosity no less than her honor was\\r\\nengaged. After a moment\\'s recollection, therefore, concluding that\\r\\nprudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would best\\r\\npromote it, she walked silently towards the table, and sat down. He\\r\\ntook the opposite chair, and for half a minute not a word was said by\\r\\neither.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray be quick, sir,\" said Elinor, impatiently; \"I have no time to\\r\\nspare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation, and seemed not to\\r\\nhear her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your sister,\" said he, with abruptness, a moment afterwards--\"is out\\r\\nof danger. I heard it from the servant. God be praised!--But is it\\r\\ntrue? is it really true?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor would not speak. He repeated the inquiry with yet greater\\r\\neagerness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For God\\'s sake tell me, is she out of danger, or is she not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: \"_I entreat you to stay._\"]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We hope she is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose up, and walked across the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had I known as much half an hour ago--But since I _am_\\r\\nhere,\"--speaking with a forced vivacity as he returned to his\\r\\nseat,--\"what does it signify?--For once, Miss Dashwood--it will be the\\r\\nlast time, perhaps--let us be cheerful together. I am in a fine mood\\r\\nfor gaiety. Tell me honestly,\"--a deeper glow overspreading his\\r\\ncheeks, \"do you think me most a knave or a fool?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever. She began to\\r\\nthink that he must be in liquor;--the strangeness of such a visit, and\\r\\nof such manners, seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this\\r\\nimpression she immediately rose, saying--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return to Combe--I am not\\r\\nat leisure to remain with you longer. Whatever your business may be\\r\\nwith me, it will be better recollected and explained to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I understand you,\" he replied, with an expressive smile, and a voice\\r\\nperfectly calm; \"yes, I am very drunk. A pint of porter with my cold\\r\\nbeef at Marlborough was enough to over-set me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Marlborough!\"--cried Elinor, more and more at a loss to understand\\r\\nwhat he would be at.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o\\'clock, and the only ten\\r\\nminutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a\\r\\nnuncheon at Marlborough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence of his eye as he\\r\\nspoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever other unpardonable folly might\\r\\nbring him to Cleveland, he was not brought there by intoxication, she\\r\\nsaid, after a moment\\'s recollection--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Willoughby, you _ought_ to feel, and I certainly _do_, that after\\r\\nwhat has passed--your coming here in this manner, and forcing yourself\\r\\nupon my notice, requires a very particular excuse. What is it, that\\r\\nyou mean by it?\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean,\"--said he, with serious energy--\"if I can, to make you hate\\r\\nme one degree less than you do _now._ I mean to offer some kind of\\r\\nexplanation, some kind of apology, for the past; to open my whole\\r\\nheart to you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always a\\r\\nblockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain something like\\r\\nforgiveness from Ma----, from your sister.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this the real reason of your coming?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my soul it is,\" was his answer, with a warmth which brought all\\r\\nthe former Willoughby to her remembrance, and in spite of herself made\\r\\nher think him sincere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If that is all, you may be satisfied already; for Marianne _does_,\\r\\nshe has _long_ forgiven you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has she?\" he cried, in the same eager tone. \"Then she has forgiven me\\r\\nbefore she ought to have done it. But she shall forgive me again, and\\r\\non more reasonable grounds. _Now_ will you listen to me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor bowed her assent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know,\" said he, after a pause of expectation on her side,\\r\\nand thoughtfulness on his own, \"how _you_ may have accounted for my\\r\\nbehaviour to your sister, or what diabolical motive you may have\\r\\nimputed to me. Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is\\r\\nworth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing. When I first\\r\\nbecame intimate in your family, I had no other intention, no other\\r\\nview in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was\\r\\nobliged to remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done\\r\\nbefore. Your sister\\'s lovely person and interesting manners could not\\r\\nbut please me; and her behaviour to me almost from the first, was of a\\r\\nkind--It is astonishing, when I reflect on what it was, and what _she_\\r\\nwas, that my heart should have been so insensible! But at first I must\\r\\nconfess, my vanity only was elevated by it. Careless of her happiness,\\r\\nthinking only of my own amusement, giving way to feelings which I had\\r\\nalways been too much in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by\\r\\nevery means in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any\\r\\ndesign of returning her affection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him with the most\\r\\nangry contempt, stopped him, by saying--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby, for you to relate, or for\\r\\nme to listen any longer. Such a beginning as this cannot be followed\\r\\nby any thing. Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the\\r\\nsubject.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I insist on you hearing the whole of it,\" he replied, \"My fortune was\\r\\nnever large, and I had always been expensive, always in the habit of\\r\\nassociating with people of better income than myself. Every year\\r\\nsince my coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my\\r\\ndebts; and though the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set\\r\\nme free; yet that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it\\r\\nhad been for some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances\\r\\nby marrying a woman of fortune. To attach myself to your sister,\\r\\ntherefore, was not a thing to be thought of; and with a meanness,\\r\\nselfishness, cruelty, which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even\\r\\nof yours, Miss Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much,--I was acting in\\r\\nthis manner, trying to engage her regard, without a thought of\\r\\nreturning it. But one thing may be said for me: even in that horrid\\r\\nstate of selfish vanity, I did not know the extent of the injury I\\r\\nmeditated, because I did not _then_ know what it was to love. But have\\r\\nI ever known it? Well may it be doubted; for, had I really loved,\\r\\ncould I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity, to avarice? or, what is\\r\\nmore, could I have sacrificed hers? But I have done it. To avoid a\\r\\ncomparative poverty, which her affection and her society would have\\r\\ndeprived of all its horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence,\\r\\nlost every thing that could make it a blessing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You did then,\" said Elinor, a little softened, \"believe yourself at\\r\\none time attached to her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood such tenderness!\\r\\nIs there a man on earth who could have done it? Yes, I found myself,\\r\\nby insensible degrees, sincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours\\r\\nof my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were\\r\\nstrictly honourable, and my feelings blameless. Even _then_, however,\\r\\nwhen fully determined on paying my addresses to her, I allowed myself\\r\\nmost improperly to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it,\\r\\nfrom an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my\\r\\ncircumstances were so greatly embarrassed. I will not reason here--nor\\r\\nwill I stop for _you_ to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse\\r\\nthan absurdity, of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was\\r\\nalready bound. The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool,\\r\\nproviding with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of\\r\\nmaking myself contemptible and wretched for ever. At last, however, my\\r\\nresolution was taken, and I had determined, as soon as I could engage\\r\\nher alone, to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her, and\\r\\nopenly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains\\r\\nto display. But in the interim--in the interim of the very few hours\\r\\nthat were to pass, before I could have an opportunity of speaking with\\r\\nher in private--a circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance--to\\r\\nruin all my resolution, and with it all my comfort. A discovery took\\r\\nplace,\"--here he hesitated and looked down. \"Mrs. Smith had somehow or\\r\\nother been informed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose\\r\\ninterest it was to deprive me of her favour, of an affair, a\\r\\nconnection--but I need not explain myself farther,\" he added, looking\\r\\nat her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye,--\"your\\r\\nparticular intimacy--you have probably heard the whole story long\\r\\nago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have,\" returned Elinor, colouring likewise, and hardening her heart\\r\\nanew against any compassion for him, \"I have heard it all. And how you\\r\\nwill explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I\\r\\nconfess is beyond my comprehension.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember,\" cried Willoughby, \"from whom you received the account.\\r\\nCould it be an impartial one? I acknowledge that her situation and her\\r\\ncharacter ought to have been respected by me. I do not mean to justify\\r\\nmyself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have\\r\\nnothing to urge--that because she was injured she was irreproachable,\\r\\nand because _I_ was a libertine, _she_ must be a saint. If the\\r\\nviolence of her passions, the weakness of her understanding--I do not\\r\\nmean, however, to defend myself. Her affection for me deserved better\\r\\ntreatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the\\r\\ntenderness which, for a very short time, had the power of creating any\\r\\nreturn. I wish--I heartily wish it had never been. But I have injured\\r\\nmore than herself; and I have injured one, whose affection for\\r\\nme--(may I say it?) was scarcely less warm than hers; and whose\\r\\nmind--Oh! how infinitely superior!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate girl--I must say\\r\\nit, unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well\\r\\nbe--your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her. Do\\r\\nnot think yourself excused by any weakness, any natural defect of\\r\\nunderstanding on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.\\r\\nYou must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself in\\r\\nDevonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay, always happy, she was\\r\\nreduced to the extremest indigence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, upon my soul, I did _not_ know it,\" he warmly replied; \"I did\\r\\nnot recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction; and common\\r\\nsense might have told her how to find it out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion may be\\r\\nguessed. The purity of her life, the formality of her notions, her\\r\\nignorance of the world,--every thing was against me. The matter itself\\r\\nI could not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it. She was\\r\\npreviously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in\\r\\ngeneral, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention,\\r\\nthe very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in my\\r\\npresent visit. In short, it ended in a total breach. By one measure I\\r\\nmight have saved myself. In the height of her morality, good woman!\\r\\nshe offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza. That could\\r\\nnot be; and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house.\\r\\nThe night following this affair--I was to go the next morning--was\\r\\nspent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be. The\\r\\nstruggle was great, but it ended too soon. My affection for Marianne,\\r\\nmy thorough conviction of her attachment to me--it was all\\r\\ninsufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty, or get the better of\\r\\nthose false ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally\\r\\ninclined to feel, and expensive society had increased. I had reason to\\r\\nbelieve myself secure of my present wife, if I chose to address her,\\r\\nand I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence\\r\\nremained for me to do. A heavy scene however awaited me, before I\\r\\ncould leave Devonshire: I was engaged to dine with you on that very\\r\\nday; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this\\r\\nengagement. But whether I should write this apology, or deliver it in\\r\\nperson, was a point of long debate. To see Marianne, I felt, would be\\r\\ndreadful, and I even doubted whether I could see her again, and keep\\r\\nto my resolution. In that point, however, I undervalued my own\\r\\nmagnanimity, as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw her\\r\\nmiserable, and left her miserable;--and left her hoping never to see\\r\\nher again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?\" said Elinor, reproachfully; \"a\\r\\nnote would have answered every purpose. Why was it necessary to\\r\\ncall?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: \"_I was formally dismissed._\"]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was necessary to my own pride. I could not bear to leave the\\r\\ncountry in a manner that might lead you, or the rest of the\\r\\nneighbourhood, to suspect any part of what had really passed between\\r\\nMrs. Smith and myself, and I resolved therefore on calling at the\\r\\ncottage, in my way to Honiton. The sight of your dear sister, however,\\r\\nwas really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter, I found her alone.\\r\\nYou were all gone I do not know where. I had left her only the evening\\r\\nbefore, so fully, so firmly resolved within my self on doing right! A\\r\\nfew hours were to have engaged her to me for ever; and I remember how\\r\\nhappy, how gay were my spirits, as I walked from the cottage to\\r\\nAllenham, satisfied with myself, delighted with every body! But in\\r\\nthis, our last interview of friendship, I approached her with a sense\\r\\nof guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling. Her\\r\\nsorrow, her disappointment, her deep regret, when I told her that I\\r\\nwas obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately--I never shall forget\\r\\nit--united too with such reliance, such confidence in me! Oh, God!\\r\\nwhat a hard-hearted rascal I was!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were both silent for a few moments. Elinor first spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you tell her that you should soon return?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know what I told her,\" he replied, impatiently; \"less than\\r\\nwas due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all likelihood much more\\r\\nthan was justified by the future. I cannot think of it. It won\\'t do.\\r\\nThen came your dear mother to torture me farther, with all her\\r\\nkindness and confidence. Thank Heaven! it _did_ torture me. I was\\r\\nmiserable. Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it\\r\\ngives me to look back on my own misery. I owe such a grudge to myself\\r\\nfor the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart, that all my past\\r\\nsufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now. Well, I\\r\\nwent, left all that I loved, and went to those to whom, at best, I was\\r\\nonly indifferent. My journey to town--travelling with my own horses,\\r\\nand therefore so tediously--no creature to speak to--my own\\r\\nreflections so cheerful--when I looked forward every thing so\\r\\ninviting!--when I looked back at Barton, the picture so soothing!--oh,\\r\\nit was a blessed journey!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, sir,\" said Elinor, who, though pitying him, grew impatient for\\r\\nhis departure, \"and this is all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town? That infamous letter?\\r\\nDid she show it you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I saw every note that passed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When the first of hers reached me (as it immediately did, for I was\\r\\nin town the whole time,) what I felt is, in the common phrase, not to\\r\\nbe expressed; in a more simple one--perhaps too simple to raise any\\r\\nemotion, my feelings were very, very painful. Every line, every word\\r\\nwas--in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer, were she here,\\r\\nwould forbid--a dagger to my heart. To know that Marianne was in town\\r\\nwas, in the same language, a thunderbolt. Thunderbolts and daggers!\\r\\nwhat a reproof would she have given me! her taste, her opinions--I\\r\\nbelieve they are better known to me than my own, and I am sure they\\r\\nare dearer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor\\'s heart, which had undergone many changes in the course of this\\r\\nextraordinary conversation, was now softened again;--yet she felt it\\r\\nher duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is not right, Mr. Willoughby. Remember that you are married.\\r\\nRelate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to\\r\\nhear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marianne\\'s note, by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in\\r\\nformer days, that in spite of the many, many weeks we had been\\r\\nseparated, she was as constant in her own feelings, and as full of\\r\\nfaith in the constancy of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse. I say\\r\\nawakened, because time and London, business and dissipation, had in\\r\\nsome measure quieted it, and I had been growing a fine hardened\\r\\nvillain, fancying myself indifferent to her, and choosing to fancy\\r\\nthat she too must have become indifferent to me; talking to myself of\\r\\nour past attachment as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my\\r\\nshoulders in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,\\r\\novercoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then, \\'I shall be\\r\\nheartily glad to hear she is well married.\\' But this note made me know\\r\\nmyself better. I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any\\r\\nother woman in the world, and that I was using her infamously. But\\r\\nevery thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me. To retreat\\r\\nwas impossible. All that I had to do, was to avoid you both. I sent no\\r\\nanswer to Marianne, intending by that to preserve myself from her\\r\\nfarther notice; and for some time I was even determined not to call\\r\\nin Berkeley Street; but at last, judging it wiser to affect the air of\\r\\na cool, common acquaintance than anything else, I watched you all\\r\\nsafely out of the house one morning, and left my name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Watched us out of the house!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Even so. You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you, how\\r\\noften I was on the point of falling in with you. I have entered many a\\r\\nshop to avoid your sight, as the carriage drove by. Lodging as I did\\r\\nin Bond Street, there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a\\r\\nglimpse of one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant\\r\\nwatchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing desire to keep\\r\\nout of your sight, could have separated us so long. I avoided the\\r\\nMiddletons as much as possible, as well as everybody else who was\\r\\nlikely to prove an acquaintance in common. Not aware of their being in\\r\\ntown, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe, the first day of\\r\\nhis coming, and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings\\'s. He\\r\\nasked me to a party, a dance at his house in the evening. Had he _not_\\r\\ntold me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there, I\\r\\nshould have felt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him. The\\r\\nnext morning brought another short note from Marianne--still\\r\\naffectionate, open, artless, confiding--everything that could make\\r\\n_my_ conduct most hateful. I could not answer it. I tried--but could\\r\\nnot frame a sentence. But I thought of her, I believe, every moment of\\r\\nthe day. If you _can_ pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it\\r\\nwas _then._ With my head and heart full of your sister, I was forced\\r\\nto play the happy lover to another woman! Those three or four weeks\\r\\nwere worse than all. Well, at last, as I need not tell you, you were\\r\\nforced on me; and what a sweet figure I cut! what an evening of agony\\r\\nit was! Marianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me\\r\\nWilloughby in such a tone! Oh, God! holding out her hand to me, asking\\r\\nme for an explanation, with those bewitching eyes fixed in such\\r\\nspeaking solicitude on my face! and Sophia, jealous as the devil on\\r\\nthe other hand, looking all that was--Well, it does not signify; it is\\r\\nover now. Such an evening! I ran away from you all as soon as I could;\\r\\nbut not before I had seen Marianne\\'s sweet face as white as death.\\r\\n_That_ was the last, last look I ever had of her; the last manner in\\r\\nwhich she appeared to me. It was a horrid sight! yet when I thought\\r\\nof her to-day as really dying, it was a kind of comfort to me to\\r\\nimagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those, who saw her\\r\\nlast in this world. She was before me, constantly before me, as I\\r\\ntravelled, in the same look and hue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: \"_I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight._\"]\\r\\n\\r\\nA short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded. Willoughby first\\r\\nrousing himself, broke it thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, let me make haste and be gone. Your sister is certainly better,\\r\\ncertainly out of danger?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are assured of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your poor mother, too!--doting on Marianne.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter; have you any thing\\r\\nto say about that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, _that_ in particular. Your sister wrote to me again, you\\r\\nknow, the very next morning. You saw what she said. I was breakfasting\\r\\nat the Ellisons,--and her letter, with some others, was brought to me\\r\\nthere from my lodgings. It happened to catch Sophia\\'s eye before it\\r\\ncaught mine;--and its size, the elegance of the paper, the hand-writing\\r\\naltogether, immediately gave her a suspicion. Some vague report had\\r\\nreached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire,\\r\\nand what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had\\r\\nmarked who the young lady was, and made her more jealous than ever.\\r\\nAffecting that air of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a\\r\\nwoman one loves, she opened the letter directly, and read its contents.\\r\\nShe was well paid for her impudence. She read what made her wretched.\\r\\nHer wretchedness I could have borne, but her passion--her malice--at all\\r\\nevents it must be appeased. And, in short, what do you think of my\\r\\nwife\\'s style of letter-writing?--delicate--tender--truly feminine--was\\r\\nit not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your wife! The letter was in your own hand-writing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as\\r\\nI was ashamed to put my name to. The original was all her own--her own\\r\\nhappy thoughts and gentle diction. But what could I do! we were\\r\\nengaged, every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed--but I am\\r\\ntalking like a fool. Preparation! Day! In honest words, her money was\\r\\nnecessary to me, and in a situation like mine, any thing was to be\\r\\ndone to prevent a rupture. And after all, what did it signify to my\\r\\ncharacter in the opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what\\r\\nlanguage my answer was couched? It must have been only to one end. My\\r\\nbusiness was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether I did it with\\r\\na bow or a bluster was of little importance. \\'I am ruined for ever in\\r\\ntheir opinion,\\' said I to myself; \\'I am shut out for ever from their\\r\\nsociety, they already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter\\r\\nwill only make them think me a blackguard one.\\' Such were my\\r\\nreasonings, as, in a sort of desperate carelessness, I copied my\\r\\nwife\\'s words, and parted with the last relics of Marianne. Her three\\r\\nnotes--unluckily they were all in my pocket-book, or I should have\\r\\ndenied their existence, and hoarded them for ever--I was forced to put\\r\\nthem up, and could not even kiss them. And the lock of hair--that too\\r\\nI had always carried about me in the same pocket-book, which was now\\r\\nsearched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,--the dear\\r\\nlock--all, every memento was torn from me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable,\" said Elinor,\\r\\nwhile her voice, in spite of herself, betrayed her compassionate\\r\\nemotion; \"you ought not to speak in this way, either of Mrs.\\r\\nWilloughby or my sister. You had made your own choice. It was not\\r\\nforced on you. Your wife has a claim to your politeness, to your\\r\\nrespect, at least. She must be attached to you, or she would not have\\r\\nmarried you. To treat her with unkindness, to speak of her slightingly\\r\\nis no atonement to Marianne--nor can I suppose it a relief to your own\\r\\nconscience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not talk to me of my wife,\" said he with a heavy sigh. \"She does\\r\\nnot deserve your compassion. She knew I had no regard for her when we\\r\\nmarried. Well, married we were, and came down to Combe Magna to be\\r\\nhappy, and afterwards returned to town to be gay. And now do you pity\\r\\nme, Miss Dashwood? or have I said all this to no purpose? Am I,--be\\r\\nit only one degree,--am I less guilty in your opinion than I was\\r\\nbefore? My intentions were not always wrong. Have I explained away any\\r\\npart of my guilt?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, you have certainly removed something--a little. You have proved\\r\\nyourself, on the whole, less faulty than I had believed you. You have\\r\\nproved your heart less wicked, much less wicked. But I hardly\\r\\nknow--the misery that you have inflicted--I hardly know what could\\r\\nhave made it worse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered, what I have\\r\\nbeen telling you?--Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as\\r\\nwell as in yours. You tell me that she has forgiven me already. Let me\\r\\nbe able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart, and of my\\r\\npresent feelings, will draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural,\\r\\nmore gentle, less dignified, forgiveness. Tell her of my misery and my\\r\\npenitence--tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her, and if\\r\\nyou will, that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be\\r\\ncalled, your justification. But you have not explained to me the\\r\\nparticular reason of your coming now, nor how you heard of her\\r\\nillness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against Sir John Middleton,\\r\\nand when he saw who I was, for the first time these two months--he\\r\\nspoke to me. That he had cut me ever since my marriage, I had seen\\r\\nwithout surprise or resentment. Now, however, his good-natured,\\r\\nhonest, stupid soul, full of indignation against me, and concern for\\r\\nyour sister, could not resist the temptation of telling me what he\\r\\nknew ought to, though probably he did not think it _would_, vex me\\r\\nhorridly. As bluntly as he could speak it, therefore, he told me that\\r\\nMarianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland--a letter\\r\\nthat morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most\\r\\nimminent--the Palmers are all gone off in a fright, &c. I was too much\\r\\nshocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the\\r\\nundiscerning Sir John. His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer;\\r\\nand so much of his ill-will was done away, that when we parted, he\\r\\nalmost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise\\r\\nabout a pointer puppy. What I felt on hearing that your sister was\\r\\ndying, and dying too, believing me the greatest villain upon earth,\\r\\nscorning, hating me in her latest moments--for how could I tell what\\r\\nhorrid projects might not have been imputed? _One_ person I was sure\\r\\nwould represent me as capable of any thing. What I felt was dreadful!\\r\\nMy resolution was soon made, and at eight o\\'clock this morning I was\\r\\nin my carriage. Now you know all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor made no answer. Her thoughts were silently fixed on the\\r\\nirreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent\\r\\nhabits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had made in the mind, the\\r\\ncharacter, the happiness, of a man who, to every advantage of person\\r\\nand talents, united a disposition naturally open and honest, and a\\r\\nfeeling, affectionate temper. The world had made him extravagant and\\r\\nvain--Extravagance and vanity had made him cold-hearted and selfish.\\r\\nVanity, while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of\\r\\nanother, had involved him in a real attachment, which extravagance, or\\r\\nat least its offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed. Each\\r\\nfaulty propensity in leading him to evil, had led him likewise to\\r\\npunishment. The attachment, from which against honour, against\\r\\nfeeling, against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself,\\r\\nnow, when no longer allowable, governed every thought; and the\\r\\nconnection, for the sake of which he had, with little scruple, left\\r\\nher sister to misery, was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to\\r\\nhimself of a far more incurable nature. From a reverie of this kind\\r\\nshe was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby, who,\\r\\nrousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful, started up in\\r\\npreparation for going, and said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is no use in staying here; I must be off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you going back to town?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No--to Combe Magna. I have business there; from thence to town in a\\r\\nday or two. Good bye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe held out his hand. She could not refuse to give him hers;--he\\r\\npressed it with affection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you _do_ think something better of me than you did?\"--said he,\\r\\nletting it fall, and leaning against the mantelpiece as if forgetting\\r\\nhe was to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor assured him that she did;--that she forgave, pitied, wished him\\r\\nwell--was even interested in his happiness--and added some gentle\\r\\ncounsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it. His answer was\\r\\nnot very encouraging.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As to that,\" said he, \"I must rub through the world as well as I can.\\r\\nDomestic happiness is out of the question. If, however, I am allowed\\r\\nto think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions,\\r\\nit may be the means--it may put me on my guard--at least, it may be\\r\\nsomething to live for. Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever.\\r\\nWere I even by any blessed chance at liberty again--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor stopped him with a reproof.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\"--he replied--\"once more good bye. I shall now go away and live\\r\\nin dread of one event.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your sister\\'s marriage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very wrong. She can never be more lost to you than she is\\r\\nnow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But she will be gained by some one else. And if that some one should\\r\\nbe the very he whom, of all others, I could least bear--but I will not\\r\\nstay to rob myself of all your compassionate good-will, by showing that\\r\\nwhere I have most injured I can least forgive. Good bye,--God bless\\r\\nyou!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with these words, he almost ran out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor, for some time after he left her, for some time even after the\\r\\nsound of his carriage had died away, remained too much oppressed by a\\r\\ncrowd of ideas, widely differing in themselves, but of which sadness\\r\\nwas the general result, to think even of her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilloughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the\\r\\nmost worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite of all his faults, excited\\r\\na degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them, which\\r\\nmade her think of him as now separated for ever from her family, with\\r\\na tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she soon acknowledged\\r\\nwithin herself--to his wishes than to his merits. She felt that his\\r\\ninfluence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought\\r\\nnot in reason to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction,\\r\\nthat open, affectionate, and lively manner which it was no merit to\\r\\npossess; and by that still ardent love for Marianne, which it was not\\r\\neven innocent to indulge. But she felt that it was so, long, long\\r\\nbefore she could feel his influence less.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne, she found her\\r\\njust awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of\\r\\nher hopes. Elinor\\'s heart was full. The past, the present, the future,\\r\\nWilloughby\\'s visit, Marianne\\'s safety, and her mother\\'s expected\\r\\narrival, threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept\\r\\noff every indication of fatigue, and made her only fearful of\\r\\nbetraying herself to her sister. Short was the time, however, in which\\r\\nthat fear could affect her, for within half an hour after Willoughby\\'s\\r\\nleaving the house, she was again called down stairs by the sound of\\r\\nanother carriage. Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary\\r\\nmoment\\'s horrible suspense, she ran immediately into the hall, and\\r\\nreached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as\\r\\nshe entered it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the house had produced\\r\\nalmost the conviction of Marianne\\'s being no more, had no voice to\\r\\ninquire after her, no voice even for Elinor; but _she_, waiting\\r\\nneither for salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;\\r\\nand her mother, catching it with all her usual warmth, was in a moment\\r\\nas much overcome by her happiness, as she had been before by her\\r\\nfears. She was supported into the drawing-room between her daughter\\r\\nand her friend; and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable\\r\\nto speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her at\\r\\nintervals to press Colonel Brandon\\'s hand, with a look which spoke at\\r\\nonce her gratitude, and her conviction of his sharing with herself in\\r\\nthe bliss of the moment. He shared it, however, in a silence even\\r\\ngreater than her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself, to see Marianne was\\r\\nher first desire; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child,\\r\\nrendered dearer to her than ever by absence, unhappiness, and danger.\\r\\nElinor\\'s delight, as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only\\r\\nchecked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther\\r\\nsleep;--but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent, when\\r\\nthe life of a child was at stake, and Marianne, satisfied in knowing\\r\\nher mother was near her, and conscious of being too weak for\\r\\nconversation, submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by\\r\\nevery nurse around her. Mrs. Dashwood _would_ sit up with her all\\r\\nnight; and Elinor, in compliance with her mother\\'s entreaty, went to\\r\\nbed. But the rest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours\\r\\nof the most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite, was kept off by\\r\\nirritation of spirits. Willoughby, \"poor Willoughby,\" as she now\\r\\nallowed herself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; she would\\r\\nnot but have heard his vindication for the world, and now blamed, now\\r\\nacquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before. But her\\r\\npromise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful. She\\r\\ndreaded the performance of it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne\\r\\nmight be; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be\\r\\nhappy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower.\\r\\nThen, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself, felt that to\\r\\n_his_ sufferings and _his_ constancy far more than to his rival\\'s, the\\r\\nreward of her sister was due, and wished any thing rather than Mrs.\\r\\nWilloughby\\'s death.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shock of Colonel Brandon\\'s errand at Barton had been much softened\\r\\nto Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm; for so great was her\\r\\nuneasiness about Marianne, that she had already determined to set out\\r\\nfor Cleveland on that very day, without waiting for any further\\r\\nintelligence, and had so far settled her journey before his arrival,\\r\\nthat the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret\\r\\naway, as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be\\r\\ninfection.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant cheerfulness\\r\\nof Mrs. Dashwood\\'s looks and spirits proved her to be, as she\\r\\nrepeatedly declared herself, one of the happiest women in the world.\\r\\nElinor could not hear the declaration, nor witness its proofs without\\r\\nsometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward. But\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account of her own\\r\\ndisappointment which Elinor had sent her, was led away by the\\r\\nexuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it.\\r\\nMarianne was restored to her from a danger in which, as she now began\\r\\nto feel, her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate\\r\\nattachment to Willoughby, had contributed to place her; and in her\\r\\nrecovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor. It\\r\\nwas thus imparted to her, as soon as any opportunity of private\\r\\nconference between them occurred.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At last we are alone. My Elinor, you do not yet know all my\\r\\nhappiness. Colonel Brandon loves Marianne. He has told me so himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer daughter, feeling by turns both pleased and pained, surprised and\\r\\nnot surprised, was all silent attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should wonder at your\\r\\ncomposure now. Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my\\r\\nfamily, I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon\\'s marrying one of you\\r\\nas the object most desirable. And I believe Marianne will be the most\\r\\nhappy with him of the two.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so, because\\r\\nsatisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their\\r\\nage, characters, or feelings, could be given;--but her mother must\\r\\nalways be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject,\\r\\nand therefore instead of an inquiry, she passed it off with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled. It came\\r\\nout quite unawares, quite undesignedly. I, you may well believe, could\\r\\ntalk of nothing but my child;--he could not conceal his distress; I\\r\\nsaw that it equalled my own, and he perhaps, thinking that mere\\r\\nfriendship, as the world now goes, would not justify so warm a\\r\\nsympathy--or rather, not thinking at all, I suppose--giving way to\\r\\nirresistible feelings, made me acquainted with his earnest, tender,\\r\\nconstant, affection for Marianne. He has loved her, my Elinor, ever\\r\\nsince the first moment of seeing her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, however, Elinor perceived,--not the language, not the\\r\\nprofessions of Colonel Brandon, but the natural embellishments of her\\r\\nmother\\'s active fancy, which fashioned every thing delightful to her\\r\\nas it chose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His regard for her, infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby\\r\\never felt or feigned, as much more warm, as more sincere or constant,\\r\\nwhich ever we are to call it, has subsisted through all the knowledge\\r\\nof dear Marianne\\'s unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!\\r\\nand without selfishness, without encouraging a hope! could he have\\r\\nseen her happy with another. Such a noble mind! such openness, such\\r\\nsincerity! No one can be deceived in _him._\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colonel Brandon\\'s character,\" said Elinor, \"as an excellent man, is\\r\\nwell established.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know it is,\" replied her mother seriously, \"or after such a\\r\\nwarning, I should be the last to encourage such affection, or even to\\r\\nbe pleased by it. But his coming for me as he did, with such active,\\r\\nsuch ready friendship, is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of\\r\\nmen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His character, however,\" answered Elinor, \"does not rest on _one_ act\\r\\nof kindness, to which his affection for Marianne, were humanity out of\\r\\nthe case, would have prompted him. To Mrs. Jennings, to the\\r\\nMiddletons, he has been long and intimately known; they equally love\\r\\nand respect him; and even my own knowledge of him, though lately\\r\\nacquired, is very considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem\\r\\nhim, that if Marianne can be happy with him, I shall be as ready as\\r\\nyourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the\\r\\nworld. What answer did you give him? Did you allow him to hope?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself.\\r\\nMarianne might at that moment be dying. But he did not ask for hope or\\r\\nencouragement. His was an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible\\r\\neffusion to a soothing friend, not an application to a parent. Yet\\r\\nafter a time I _did_ say, for at first I was quite overcome, that if\\r\\nshe lived, as I trusted she might, my greatest happiness would lie in\\r\\npromoting their marriage; and since our arrival, since our delightful\\r\\nsecurity, I have repeated it to him more fully, have given him every\\r\\nencouragement in my power. Time, a very little time, I tell him, will\\r\\ndo everything; Marianne\\'s heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a\\r\\nman as Willoughby. His own merits must soon secure it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To judge from the Colonel\\'s spirits, however, you have not yet made\\r\\nhim equally sanguine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. He thinks Marianne\\'s affection too deeply rooted for any change\\r\\nin it under a great length of time, and even supposing her heart again\\r\\nfree, is too diffident of himself to believe, that with such a\\r\\ndifference of age and disposition he could ever attach her. There,\\r\\nhowever, he is quite mistaken. His age is only so much beyond hers as\\r\\nto be an advantage, as to make his character and principles\\r\\nfixed;--and his disposition, I am well convinced, is exactly the very\\r\\none to make your sister happy. And his person, his manners too, are\\r\\nall in his favour. My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is\\r\\nnot so handsome as Willoughby--but at the same time, there is\\r\\nsomething much more pleasing in his countenance. There was always a\\r\\nsomething,--if you remember,--in Willoughby\\'s eyes at times, which I\\r\\ndid not like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor could _not_ remember it;--but her mother, without waiting for\\r\\nher assent, continued--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And his manners, the Colonel\\'s manners are not only more pleasing to\\r\\nme than Willoughby\\'s ever were, but they are of a kind I well know to\\r\\nbe more solidly attaching to Marianne. Their gentleness, their\\r\\ngenuine attention to other people, and their manly unstudied\\r\\nsimplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition, than the\\r\\nliveliness--often artificial, and often ill-timed of the other. I am\\r\\nvery sure myself, that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable, as\\r\\nhe has proved himself the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been\\r\\nso happy with _him_ as she will be with Colonel Brandon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused. Her daughter could not quite agree with her, but her\\r\\ndissent was not heard, and therefore gave no offence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Delaford, she will be within an easy distance of me,\" added Mrs.\\r\\nDashwood, \"even if I remain at Barton; and in all probability,--for I\\r\\nhear it is a large village,--indeed there certainly _must_ be some\\r\\nsmall house or cottage close by, that would suit us quite as well as\\r\\nour present situation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford!--but\\r\\nher spirit was stubborn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His fortune too!--for at my time of life you know, everybody cares\\r\\nabout _that_;--and though I neither know nor desire to know, what it\\r\\nreally is, I am sure it must be a good one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person, and\\r\\nElinor withdrew to think it all over in private, to wish success to\\r\\nher friend, and yet in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLVI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne\\'s illness, though weakening in its kind, had not been long\\r\\nenough to make her recovery slow; and with youth, natural strength,\\r\\nand her mother\\'s presence in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to\\r\\nenable her to remove, within four days after the arrival of the\\r\\nlatter, into Mrs. Palmer\\'s dressing-room. When there, at her own\\r\\nparticular request, for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to\\r\\nhim for fetching her mother, Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered looks, and in\\r\\nreceiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him, was\\r\\nsuch, as, in Elinor\\'s conjecture, must arise from something more than\\r\\nhis affection for Marianne, or the consciousness of its being known to\\r\\nothers; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying\\r\\ncomplexion as he looked at her sister, the probable recurrence of many\\r\\npast scenes of misery to his mind, brought back by that resemblance\\r\\nbetween Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged, and now strengthened\\r\\nby the hollow eye, the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,\\r\\nand the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than her daughter, but\\r\\nwith a mind very differently influenced, and therefore watching to\\r\\nvery different effect, saw nothing in the Colonel\\'s behaviour but what\\r\\narose from the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in the\\r\\nactions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that\\r\\nsomething more than gratitude already dawned.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of another day or two, Marianne growing visibly stronger\\r\\nevery twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood, urged equally by her own and her\\r\\ndaughter\\'s wishes, began to talk of removing to Barton. On _her_\\r\\nmeasures depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could not\\r\\nquit Cleveland during the Dashwoods\\' stay; and Colonel Brandon was\\r\\nsoon brought, by their united request, to consider his own abode there\\r\\nas equally determinate, if not equally indispensable. At his and Mrs.\\r\\nJennings\\'s united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on to\\r\\naccept the use of his carriage on her journey back, for the better\\r\\naccommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel, at the joint\\r\\ninvitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings, whose active\\r\\ngood-nature made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well\\r\\nas herself, engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the\\r\\ncottage, in the course of a few weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day of separation and departure arrived; and Marianne, after\\r\\ntaking so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so\\r\\nearnestly grateful, so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due\\r\\nto her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and\\r\\nbidding Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was\\r\\ncarefully assisted by him into the carriage, of which he seemed\\r\\nanxious that she should engross at least half. Mrs. Dashwood and\\r\\nElinor then followed, and the others were left by themselves, to talk\\r\\nof the travellers, and feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings\\r\\nwas summoned to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid\\r\\nfor the loss of her two young companions; and Colonel Brandon\\r\\nimmediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne bore her journey\\r\\non both, without essential fatigue. Every thing that the most zealous\\r\\naffection, the most solicitous care could do to render her\\r\\ncomfortable, was the office of each watchful companion, and each found\\r\\ntheir reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits. To\\r\\nElinor, the observation of the latter was particularly grateful. She,\\r\\nwho had seen her week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by\\r\\nanguish of heart which she had neither courage to speak of, nor\\r\\nfortitude to conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally\\r\\nshare, an apparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as\\r\\nshe trusted of serious reflection, must eventually lead her to\\r\\ncontentment and cheerfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they approached Barton, indeed, and entered on scenes of which\\r\\nevery field and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful\\r\\nrecollection, she grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her\\r\\nface from their notice, sat earnestly gazing through the window. But\\r\\nhere, Elinor could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw, as she\\r\\nassisted Marianne from the carriage, that she had been crying, she saw\\r\\nonly an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender\\r\\nthan pity, and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise. In the whole\\r\\nof her subsequent manner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened\\r\\nto reasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common\\r\\nsitting-room, than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of\\r\\nresolute firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the\\r\\nsight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could\\r\\nbe connected. She said little, but every sentence aimed at\\r\\ncheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed\\r\\naway without the atonement of a smile. After dinner she would try her\\r\\npiano-forte. She went to it; but the music on which her eye first\\r\\nrested was an opera, procured for her by Willoughby, containing some\\r\\nof their favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name\\r\\nin his hand-writing. That would not do. She shook her head, put the\\r\\nmusic aside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained\\r\\nof feebleness in her fingers, and closed the instrument again;\\r\\ndeclaring however with firmness as she did so, that she should in\\r\\nfuture practice much.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms. On the\\r\\ncontrary, with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest, she looked\\r\\nand spoke with more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of\\r\\nMargaret\\'s return, and talking of the dear family party which would\\r\\nthen be restored, of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society, as\\r\\nthe only happiness worth a wish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When the weather is settled, and I have recovered my strength,\" said\\r\\nshe, \"we will take long walks together every day. We will walk to the\\r\\nfarm at the edge of the down, and see how the children go on; we will\\r\\nwalk to Sir John\\'s new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland;\\r\\nand we will often go the old ruins of the Priory, and try to trace its\\r\\nfoundations as far as we are told they once reached. I know we shall\\r\\nbe happy. I know the summer will pass happily away. I mean never to be\\r\\nlater in rising than six, and from that time till dinner I shall\\r\\ndivide every moment between music and reading. I have formed my plan,\\r\\nand am determined to enter on a course of serious study. Our own\\r\\nlibrary is too well known to me, to be resorted to for any thing\\r\\nbeyond mere amusement. But there are many works well worth reading at\\r\\nthe Park; and there are others of more modern production which I know\\r\\nI can borrow of Colonel Brandon. By reading only six hours a-day, I\\r\\nshall gain in the course of a twelvemonth a great deal of instruction\\r\\nwhich I now feel myself to want.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this;\\r\\nthough smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her\\r\\nto the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining, now at work\\r\\nin introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and\\r\\nvirtuous self-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she\\r\\nremembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled, and feared\\r\\nshe had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of\\r\\nMarianne, and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy\\r\\ntranquillity. Willing therefore to delay the evil hour, she resolved\\r\\nto wait till her sister\\'s health were more secure, before she\\r\\nappointed it. But the resolution was made only to be broken.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: \"_And see how the children go on._\"]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne had been two or three days at home, before the weather was\\r\\nfine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out. But at last a\\r\\nsoft, genial morning appeared; such as might tempt the daughter\\'s\\r\\nwishes and the mother\\'s confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor\\'s\\r\\narm, was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue, in\\r\\nthe lane before the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness of Marianne in\\r\\nan exercise hitherto untried since her illness required;--and they had\\r\\nadvanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the\\r\\nhill, the important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes turned\\r\\ntowards it, Marianne calmly said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There, exactly there,\"--pointing with one hand, \"on that projecting\\r\\nmound,--there I fell; and there I first saw Willoughby.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she added,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the\\r\\nspot! shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?\" hesitatingly it was\\r\\nsaid. \"Or will it be wrong? I can talk of it now, I hope, as I ought\\r\\nto do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor tenderly invited her to be open.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As for regret,\" said Marianne, \"I have done with that, as far as _he_\\r\\nis concerned. I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have\\r\\nbeen for him, but what they are _now._ At present, if I could be\\r\\nsatisfied on one point, if I could be allowed to think that he was not\\r\\n_always_ acting a part, not _always_ deceiving me; but above all, if I\\r\\ncould be assured that he never was so _very_ wicked as my fears have\\r\\nsometimes fancied him, since the story of that unfortunate girl--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stopped. Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you could be assured of that, you think you should be easy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in it; for not only is it\\r\\nhorrible to suspect a person, who has been what _he_ has been to _me_,\\r\\nof such designs, but what must it make me appear to myself? What in a\\r\\nsituation like mine, but a most shamefully unguarded affection could\\r\\nexpose me to--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How then,\" asked her sister, \"would you account for his behaviour?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would suppose him--Oh, how gladly would I suppose him!--only\\r\\nfickle, very, very fickle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor said no more. She was debating within herself on the\\r\\neligibility of beginning her story directly, or postponing it till\\r\\nMarianne were in stronger health; and they crept on for a few minutes\\r\\nin silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not wishing him too much good,\" said Marianne at last with a\\r\\nsigh, \"when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant\\r\\nthan my own. He will suffer enough in them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you compare your conduct with his?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. I compare it with what it ought to have been; I compare it with\\r\\nyours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our situations have borne little resemblance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have borne more than our conduct. Do not, my dearest Elinor, let\\r\\nyour kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure. My illness\\r\\nhas made me think. It has given me leisure and calmness for serious\\r\\nrecollection. Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I was\\r\\nperfectly able to reflect. I considered the past: I saw in my own\\r\\nbehaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn,\\r\\nnothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of kindness\\r\\nto others. I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings, and\\r\\nthat my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave. My\\r\\nillness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by myself by such\\r\\nnegligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the time to be wrong.\\r\\nHad I died, it would have been self-destruction. I did not know my\\r\\ndanger till the danger was removed; but with such feelings as these\\r\\nreflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery,--wonder that the very\\r\\neagerness of my desire to live, to have time for atonement to my God,\\r\\nand to you all, did not kill me at once. Had I died, in what peculiar\\r\\nmisery should I have left you, my nurse, my friend, my sister! You, who\\r\\nhad seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days; who had known\\r\\nall the murmurings of my heart! How should I have lived in _your_\\r\\nremembrance! My mother too! How could you have consoled her! I cannot\\r\\nexpress my own abhorrence of myself. Whenever I looked towards the past,\\r\\nI saw some duty neglected, or some failing indulged. Every body seemed\\r\\ninjured by me. The kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I\\r\\nhad repaid with ungrateful contempt. To the Middletons, to the Palmers,\\r\\nthe Steeles, to every common acquaintance even, I had been insolent and\\r\\nunjust; with a heart hardened against their merits, and a temper\\r\\nirritated by their very attention. To John, to Fanny, yes, even to them,\\r\\nlittle as they deserve, I had given less than their due. But you, you\\r\\nabove all, above my mother, had been wronged by me. I, and only I, knew\\r\\nyour heart and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me?--not to any\\r\\ncompassion that could benefit you or myself. Your example was before me;\\r\\nbut to what avail? Was I more considerate of you and your comfort? Did I\\r\\nimitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking any part\\r\\nin those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which\\r\\nyou had hitherto been left to discharge alone? No; not less when I knew\\r\\nyou to be unhappy, than when I had believed you at ease, did I turn away\\r\\nfrom every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to\\r\\nexist but with me, regretting only _that_ heart which had deserted and\\r\\nwronged me, and leaving you, for I professed an unbounded affection, to\\r\\nbe miserable for my sake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit; and Elinor,\\r\\nimpatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her instantly\\r\\nthat praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well\\r\\ndeserved. Marianne pressed her hand and replied--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very good. The future must be my proof. I have laid down my\\r\\nplan, and if I am capable of adhering to it--my feelings shall be\\r\\ngoverned and my temper improved. They shall no longer worry others,\\r\\nnor torture myself. I shall now live solely for my family. You, my\\r\\nmother, and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me; you will\\r\\nshare my affections entirely between you. From you, from my home, I\\r\\nshall never again have the smallest incitement to move; and if I do\\r\\nmix in other society, it will be only to show that my spirit is\\r\\nhumbled, my heart amended, and that I can practise the civilities, the\\r\\nlesser duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance. As for\\r\\nWilloughby--to say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him,\\r\\nwould be idle. His remembrance can be overcome by no change of\\r\\ncircumstances or opinions. But it shall be regulated, it shall be\\r\\nchecked by religion, by reason, by constant employment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused--and added in a low voice, \"If I could but know _his_\\r\\nheart, everything would become easy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor, who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or\\r\\nimpropriety of speedily hazarding her narration, without feeling at\\r\\nall nearer decision than at first, heard this; and perceiving that as\\r\\nreflection did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself\\r\\nleading to the fact.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe managed the recital, as she hoped, with address; prepared her\\r\\nanxious listener with caution; related simply and honestly the chief\\r\\npoints on which Willoughby grounded his apology; did justice to his\\r\\nrepentance, and softened only his protestations of present regard.\\r\\nMarianne said not a word. She trembled, her eyes were fixed on the\\r\\nground, and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them. A\\r\\nthousand inquiries sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge\\r\\none. She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand,\\r\\nunknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister\\'s, and tears\\r\\ncovered her cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards home; and till they\\r\\nreached the door of the cottage, easily conjecturing what her\\r\\ncuriosity must be though no question was suffered to speak it, talked\\r\\nof nothing but Willoughby, and their conversation together; and was\\r\\ncarefully minute in every particular of speech and look, where\\r\\nminuteness could be safely indulged. As soon as they entered the\\r\\nhouse, Marianne with a kiss of gratitude and these two words just\\r\\narticulate through her tears, \"Tell mama,\" withdrew from her sister\\r\\nand walked slowly up stairs. Elinor would not attempt to disturb a\\r\\nsolitude so reasonable as what she now sought; and with a mind\\r\\nanxiously pre-arranging its result, and a resolution of reviving the\\r\\nsubject again, should Marianne fail to do it, she turned into the\\r\\nparlour to fulfill her parting injunction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLVII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former\\r\\nfavourite. She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his\\r\\nimputed guilt;--she was sorry for him;--she wished him happy. But the\\r\\nfeelings of the past could not be recalled. Nothing could restore him\\r\\nwith a faith unbroken--a character unblemished, to Marianne. Nothing\\r\\ncould do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through\\r\\nhis means, nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza. Nothing\\r\\ncould replace him, therefore, in her former esteem, nor injure the\\r\\ninterests of Colonel Brandon.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard Willoughby\\'s story from\\r\\nhimself,--had she witnessed his distress, and been under the influence\\r\\nof his countenance and his manner, it is probable that her compassion\\r\\nwould have been greater. But it was neither in Elinor\\'s power, nor in\\r\\nher wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her retailed\\r\\nexplanation, as had at first been called forth in herself. Reflection\\r\\nhad given calmness to her judgment, and sobered her own opinion of\\r\\nWilloughby\\'s deserts; she wished, therefore, to declare only the\\r\\nsimple truth, and lay open such facts as were really due to his\\r\\ncharacter, without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy\\r\\nastray.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening, when they were all three together, Marianne began\\r\\nvoluntarily to speak of him again; but that it was not without an\\r\\neffort, the restless, unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for\\r\\nsome time previously sitting, her rising colour, as she spoke, and her\\r\\nunsteady voice, plainly showed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish to assure you both,\" said she, \"that I see every thing--as you\\r\\ncan desire me to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing\\r\\ntenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished to hear her sister\\'s\\r\\nunbiased opinion, by an eager sign, engaged her silence. Marianne\\r\\nslowly continued--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a great relief to me--what Elinor told me this morning--I have\\r\\nnow heard exactly what I wished to hear.\"--For some moments her voice\\r\\nwas lost; but recovering herself, she added, and with greater calmness\\r\\nthan before--\"I am now perfectly satisfied, I wish for no change. I\\r\\nnever could have been happy with him, after knowing, as sooner or\\r\\nlater I must have known, all this. I should have had no confidence, no\\r\\nesteem. Nothing could have done it away to my feelings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know it--I know it,\" cried her mother. \"Happy with a man of\\r\\nlibertine practices!--With one who so injured the peace of the dearest\\r\\nof our friends, and the best of men!--No--my Marianne has not a heart\\r\\nto be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience, her sensitive\\r\\nconscience, would have felt all that the conscience of her husband\\r\\nought to have felt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne sighed, and repeated, \"I wish for no change.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You consider the matter,\" said Elinor, \"exactly as a good mind and a\\r\\nsound understanding must consider it; and I dare say you perceive, as\\r\\nwell as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances,\\r\\nreason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved\\r\\nyou in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would\\r\\nhave been poorly supported by an affection, on his side, much less\\r\\ncertain. Had you married, you must have been always poor. His\\r\\nexpensiveness is acknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct\\r\\ndeclares that self-denial is a word hardly understood by him. His\\r\\ndemands and your inexperience together, on a small, very small income,\\r\\nmust have brought on distresses which would not be the _less_ grievous\\r\\nto you, from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before.\\r\\n_Your_ sense of honour and honesty would have led you, I know, when\\r\\naware of your situation, to attempt all the economy that would appear\\r\\nto you possible: and, perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched\\r\\nonly on your own comfort, you might have been suffered to practice it,\\r\\nbut beyond that--and how little could the utmost of your single\\r\\nmanagement do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?\\r\\nbeyond _that_, had you endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge\\r\\n_his_ enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead of prevailing\\r\\non feelings so selfish to consent to it, you would have lessened your\\r\\nown influence on his heart, and made him regret the connection which\\r\\nhad involved him in such difficulties?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne\\'s lips quivered, and she repeated the word \"Selfish?\" in a\\r\\ntone that implied, \"do you really think him selfish?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The whole of his behaviour,\" replied Elinor, \"from the beginning to\\r\\nthe end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness. It was\\r\\nselfishness which first made him sport with your affections; which\\r\\nafterwards, when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession\\r\\nof it, and which finally carried him from Barton. His own enjoyment,\\r\\nor his own ease, was, in every particular, his ruling principle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very true. _My_ happiness never was his object.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At present,\" continued Elinor, \"he regrets what he has done. And why\\r\\ndoes he regret it?--Because he finds it has not answered towards\\r\\nhimself. It has not made him happy. His circumstances are now\\r\\nunembarrassed--he suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks\\r\\nonly that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than\\r\\nyourself. But does it follow that had he married you, he would have\\r\\nbeen happy?--The inconveniences would have been different. He would\\r\\nthen have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which, because they\\r\\nare removed, he now reckons as nothing. He would have had a wife of\\r\\nwhose temper he could make no complaint, but he would have been always\\r\\nnecessitous--always poor; and probably would soon have learned to rank\\r\\nthe innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far\\r\\nmore importance, even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a\\r\\nwife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not a doubt of it,\" said Marianne; \"and I have nothing to\\r\\nregret--nothing but my own folly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rather say your mother\\'s imprudence, my child,\" said Mrs. Dashwood;\\r\\n\"_she_ must be answerable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor, satisfied that each\\r\\nfelt their own error, wished to avoid any survey of the past that\\r\\nmight weaken her sister\\'s spirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first\\r\\nsubject, immediately continued--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from the whole of the\\r\\nstory--that all Willoughby\\'s difficulties have arisen from the first\\r\\noffence against virtue, in his behaviour to Eliza Williams. That crime\\r\\nhas been the origin of every lesser one, and of all his present\\r\\ndiscontents.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne assented most feelingly to the remark; and her mother was led\\r\\nby it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon\\'s injuries and merits, warm\\r\\nas friendship and design could unitedly dictate. Her daughter did not\\r\\nlook, however, as if much of it were heard by her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two or three\\r\\nfollowing days, that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she\\r\\nhad done; but while her resolution was unsubdued, and she still tried\\r\\nto appear cheerful and easy, her sister could safely trust to the\\r\\neffect of time upon her health.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargaret returned, and the family were again all restored to each\\r\\nother, again quietly settled at the cottage; and if not pursuing their\\r\\nusual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to\\r\\nBarton, at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward. She had heard\\r\\nnothing of him since her leaving London, nothing new of his plans,\\r\\nnothing certain even of his present abode. Some letters had passed\\r\\nbetween her and her brother, in consequence of Marianne\\'s illness; and\\r\\nin the first of John\\'s, there had been this sentence:--\"We know\\r\\nnothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no enquiries on so\\r\\nprohibited a subject, but conclude him to be still at Oxford\"; which\\r\\nwas all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence,\\r\\nfor his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.\\r\\nShe was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of his measures.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir man-servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business; and\\r\\nwhen, as he waited at table, he had satisfied the inquiries of his\\r\\nmistress as to the event of his errand, this was his voluntary\\r\\ncommunication--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose you know, ma\\'am, that Mr. Ferrars is married.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes upon Elinor, saw her\\r\\nturning pale, and fell back in her chair in hysterics. Mrs. Dashwood,\\r\\nwhose eyes, as she answered the servant\\'s inquiry, had intuitively\\r\\ntaken the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor\\'s\\r\\ncountenance how much she really suffered, and a moment afterwards,\\r\\nalike distressed by Marianne\\'s situation, knew not on which child to\\r\\nbestow her principal attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill, had sense\\r\\nenough to call one of the maids, who, with Mrs. Dashwood\\'s assistance,\\r\\nsupported her into the other room. By that time, Marianne was rather\\r\\nbetter, and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the\\r\\nmaid, returned to Elinor, who, though still much disordered, had so\\r\\nfar recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just\\r\\nbeginning an inquiry of Thomas, as to the source of his intelligence.\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor\\r\\nhad the benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: \"_I suppose you know, ma\\'am, that Mr. Ferrars is\\r\\nmarried._\"]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma\\'am, this morning in Exeter, and his lady\\r\\ntoo, Miss Steele as was. They was stopping in a chaise at the door of\\r\\nthe New London Inn, as I went there with a message from Sally at the\\r\\nPark to her brother, who is one of the post-boys. I happened to look\\r\\nup as I went by the chaise, and so I see directly it was the youngest\\r\\nMiss Steele; so I took off my hat, and she knew me and called to me,\\r\\nand inquired after you, ma\\'am, and the young ladies, especially Miss\\r\\nMarianne, and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars\\'s,\\r\\ntheir best compliments and service, and how sorry they was they had\\r\\nnot time to come on and see you, but they was in a great hurry to go\\r\\nforwards, for they was going further down for a little while, but\\r\\nhowever, when they come back, they\\'d make sure to come and see you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But did she tell you she was married, Thomas?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am. She smiled, and said how she had changed her name since\\r\\nshe was in these parts. She was always a very affable and free-spoken\\r\\nyoung lady, and very civil behaved. So, I made free to wish her joy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, I just see him leaning back in it, but he did not look\\r\\nup;--he never was a gentleman much for talking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor\\'s heart could easily account for his not putting himself\\r\\nforward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was there no one else in the carriage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am, only they two.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know where they came from?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy--Mrs. Ferrars told me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And are they going farther westward?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am--but not to bide long. They will soon be back again, and\\r\\nthen they\\'d be sure and call here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter; but Elinor knew better than\\r\\nto expect them. She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and\\r\\nwas very confident that Edward would never come near them. She\\r\\nobserved in a low voice, to her mother, that they were probably going\\r\\ndown to Mr. Pratt\\'s, near Plymouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas\\'s intelligence seemed over. Elinor looked as if she wished to\\r\\nhear more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you see them off, before you came away?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am--the horses were just coming out, but I could not bide any\\r\\nlonger; I was afraid of being late.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, she said how she was very well; and to my mind she was\\r\\nalways a very handsome young lady--and she seemed vastly contented.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood could think of no other question, and Thomas and the\\r\\ntablecloth, now alike needless, were soon afterwards dismissed.\\r\\nMarianne had already sent to say, that she should eat nothing more.\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood\\'s and Elinor\\'s appetites were equally lost, and Margaret\\r\\nmight think herself very well off, that with so much uneasiness as\\r\\nboth her sisters had lately experienced, so much reason as they had\\r\\noften had to be careless of their meals, she had never been obliged to\\r\\ngo without her dinner before.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the dessert and the wine were arranged, and Mrs. Dashwood and\\r\\nElinor were left by themselves, they remained long together in a\\r\\nsimilarity of thoughtfulness and silence. Mrs. Dashwood feared to\\r\\nhazard any remark, and ventured not to offer consolation. She now\\r\\nfound that she had erred in relying on Elinor\\'s representation of\\r\\nherself; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly\\r\\nsoftened at the time, to spare her from an increase of unhappiness,\\r\\nsuffering as she then had suffered for Marianne. She found that she\\r\\nhad been misled by the careful, the considerate attention of her\\r\\ndaughter, to think the attachment, which once she had so well\\r\\nunderstood, much slighter in reality, than she had been wont to\\r\\nbelieve, or than it was now proved to be. She feared that under this\\r\\npersuasion she had been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to\\r\\nher Elinor; that Marianne\\'s affliction, because more acknowledged,\\r\\nmore immediately before her, had too much engrossed her tenderness,\\r\\nand led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter\\r\\nsuffering almost as much, certainly with less self-provocation, and\\r\\ngreater fortitude.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor now found the difference between the expectation of an\\r\\nunpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told to consider it,\\r\\nand certainty itself. She now found, that in spite of herself, she had\\r\\nalways admitted a hope, while Edward remained single, that something\\r\\nwould occur to prevent his marrying Lucy; that some resolution of his\\r\\nown, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible opportunity of\\r\\nestablishment for the lady, would arise to assist the happiness of\\r\\nall. But he was now married; and she condemned her heart for the\\r\\nlurking flattery, which so much heightened the pain of the\\r\\nintelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat he should be married soon, before (as she imagined) he could be\\r\\nin orders, and consequently before he could be in possession of the\\r\\nliving, surprised her a little at first. But she soon saw how likely\\r\\nit was that Lucy, in her self-provident care, in her haste to secure\\r\\nhim, should overlook every thing but the risk of delay. They were\\r\\nmarried, married in town, and now hastening down to her uncle\\'s. What\\r\\nhad Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton, on seeing her\\r\\nmother\\'s servant, on hearing Lucy\\'s message!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey would soon, she supposed, be settled at\\r\\nDelaford;--Delaford,--that place in which so much conspired to give\\r\\nher an interest; which she wished to be acquainted with, and yet\\r\\ndesired to avoid. She saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house;\\r\\nsaw in Lucy, the active, contriving manager, uniting at once a desire\\r\\nof smart appearance with the utmost frugality, and ashamed to be\\r\\nsuspected of half her economical practices; pursuing her own interest\\r\\nin every thought, courting the favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs.\\r\\nJennings, and of every wealthy friend. In Edward, she knew not what\\r\\nshe saw, nor what she wished to see. Happy or unhappy, nothing pleased\\r\\nher; she turned away her head from every sketch of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London\\r\\nwould write to them to announce the event, and give farther\\r\\nparticulars,--but day after day passed off, and brought no letter, no\\r\\ntidings. Though uncertain that any one were to blame, she found fault\\r\\nwith every absent friend. They were all thoughtless or indolent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma\\'am?\" was an inquiry which\\r\\nsprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather expect to see, than to\\r\\nhear from him again. I earnestly pressed his coming to us, and should\\r\\nnot be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was gaining something, something to look forward to. Colonel\\r\\nBrandon must have some information to give.\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely had she so determined it, when the figure of a man on\\r\\nhorseback drew her eyes to the window. He stopped at their gate. It\\r\\nwas a gentleman, it was Colonel Brandon himself. Now she could hear\\r\\nmore; and she trembled in expectation of it. But--it was _not_ Colonel\\r\\nBrandon--neither his air--nor his height. Were it possible, she must\\r\\nsay it must be Edward. She looked again. He had just dismounted;--she\\r\\ncould not be mistaken,--it _was_ Edward. She moved away and sat down.\\r\\n\"He comes from Mr. Pratt\\'s purposely to see us. I _will_ be calm, I\\r\\n_will_ be mistress of myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the\\r\\nmistake. She saw her mother and Marianne change colour; saw them look\\r\\nat herself, and whisper a few sentences to each other. She would have\\r\\ngiven the world to be able to speak--and to make them understand that\\r\\nshe hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear in their behaviour to\\r\\nhim;--but she had no utterance, and was obliged to leave all to their\\r\\nown discretion.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot a syllable passed aloud. They all waited in silence for the\\r\\nappearance of their visitor. His footsteps were heard along the gravel\\r\\npath; in a moment he was in the passage, and in another he was before\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis countenance, as he entered the room, was not too happy, even for\\r\\nElinor. His complexion was white with agitation, and he looked as if\\r\\nfearful of his reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one.\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted, to the wishes of\\r\\nthat daughter, by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be\\r\\nguided in every thing, met with a look of forced complacency, gave him\\r\\nher hand, and wished him joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _It was Edward._]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply. Elinor\\'s lips\\r\\nhad moved with her mother\\'s, and, when the moment of action was over,\\r\\nshe wished that she had shaken hands with him too. But it was then too\\r\\nlate, and with a countenance meaning to be open, she sat down again\\r\\nand talked of the weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight, to conceal\\r\\nher distress; and Margaret, understanding some part, but not the whole\\r\\nof the case, thought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and\\r\\ntherefore took a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained a\\r\\nstrict silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season, a very\\r\\nawful pause took place. It was put an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who\\r\\nfelt obliged to hope that he had left Mrs. Ferrars very well. In a\\r\\nhurried manner, he replied in the affirmative.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother pause.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing the sound of her own\\r\\nvoice, now said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Longstaple!\" he replied, with an air of surprise. \"No, my mother\\r\\nis in town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I meant,\" said Elinor, taking up some work from the table, \"to\\r\\ninquire for Mrs. _Edward_ Ferrars.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe dared not look up;--but her mother and Marianne both turned their\\r\\neyes on him. He coloured, seemed perplexed, looked doubtingly, and,\\r\\nafter some hesitation, said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps you mean--my brother--you mean Mrs.--Mrs. _Robert_ Ferrars.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Robert Ferrars!\"--was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an\\r\\naccent of the utmost amazement;--and though Elinor could not speak,\\r\\neven _her_ eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder. He\\r\\nrose from his seat, and walked to the window, apparently from not\\r\\nknowing what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there, and\\r\\nwhile spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to\\r\\npieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps you do not know--you may not have heard that my brother is\\r\\nlately married to--to the youngest--to Miss Lucy Steele.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but\\r\\nElinor, who sat with her head leaning over her work, in a state of\\r\\nsuch agitation as made her hardly know where she was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"they were married last week, and are now at Dawlish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor could sit it no longer. She almost ran out of the room, and as\\r\\nsoon as the door was closed, burst into tears of joy, which at first\\r\\nshe thought would never cease. Edward, who had till then looked any\\r\\nwhere, rather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw, or\\r\\neven heard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards he fell into a\\r\\nreverie, which no remarks, no inquiries, no affectionate address of\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood could penetrate, and at last, without saying a word,\\r\\nquitted the room, and walked out towards the village, leaving the\\r\\nothers in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his\\r\\nsituation, so wonderful and so sudden,--a perplexity which they had no\\r\\nmeans of lessening but by their own conjectures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLIX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnaccountable, however, as the circumstances of his release might\\r\\nappear to the whole family, it was certain that Edward was free; and\\r\\nto what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily\\r\\npre-determined by all;--for after experiencing the blessings of _one_\\r\\nimprudent engagement, contracted without his mother\\'s consent, as he\\r\\nhad already done for more than four years, nothing less could be\\r\\nexpected of him in the failure of _that_, than the immediate\\r\\ncontraction of another.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one. It was only to ask\\r\\nElinor to marry him;--and considering that he was not altogether\\r\\ninexperienced in such a question, it might be strange that he should\\r\\nfeel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did, so much in\\r\\nneed of encouragement and fresh air.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution, however,\\r\\nhow soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred, in what manner he\\r\\nexpressed himself, and how he was received, need not be particularly\\r\\ntold. This only need be said;--that when they all sat down to table at\\r\\nfour o\\'clock, about three hours after his arrival, he had secured his\\r\\nlady, engaged her mother\\'s consent, and was not only in the rapturous\\r\\nprofession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, one\\r\\nof the happiest of men. His situation indeed was more than commonly\\r\\njoyful. He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to\\r\\nswell his heart, and raise his spirits. He was released without any\\r\\nreproach to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his\\r\\nmisery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love; and elevated at\\r\\nonce to that security with another, which he must have thought of\\r\\nalmost with despair, as soon as he had learnt to consider it with\\r\\ndesire. He was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from misery to\\r\\nhappiness; and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine,\\r\\nflowing, grateful cheerfulness, as his friends had never witnessed in\\r\\nhim before.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses, all its errors\\r\\nconfessed, and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all\\r\\nthe philosophic dignity of twenty-four.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side,\" said he, \"the\\r\\nconsequence of ignorance of the world and want of employment. Had my\\r\\nmother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen\\r\\nfrom the care of Mr. Pratt, I think, nay, I am sure, it would never\\r\\nhave happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at\\r\\nthe time, a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I\\r\\nthen had any pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a\\r\\ndistance from her for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown\\r\\nthe fancied attachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as\\r\\nin such case I must have done. But instead of having any thing to do,\\r\\ninstead of having any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to\\r\\nchoose any myself, I returned home to be completely idle; and for the\\r\\nfirst twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment,\\r\\nwhich belonging to the university would have given me; for I was not\\r\\nentered at Oxford till I was nineteen. I had therefore nothing in the\\r\\nworld to do, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not\\r\\nmake my home in every respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no\\r\\ncompanion in my brother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not\\r\\nunnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple, where I always felt\\r\\nmyself at home, and was always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I\\r\\nspent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen:\\r\\nLucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging. She was pretty\\r\\ntoo--at least I thought so _then_; and I had seen so little of other\\r\\nwomen, that I could make no comparisons, and see no defects.\\r\\nConsidering everything, therefore, I hope, foolish as our engagement\\r\\nwas, foolish as it has since in every way been proved, it was not at\\r\\nthe time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the\\r\\nhappiness of the Dashwoods, was such--so great--as promised them all,\\r\\nthe satisfaction of a sleepless night. Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be\\r\\ncomfortable, knew not how to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough,\\r\\nhow to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his\\r\\ndelicacy, nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained\\r\\nconversation together, and yet enjoy, as she wished, the sight and\\r\\nsociety of both.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne could speak _her_ happiness only by tears. Comparisons would\\r\\noccur--regrets would arise;--and her joy, though sincere as her love\\r\\nfor her sister, was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor\\r\\nlanguage.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elinor--how are _her_ feelings to be described? From the moment of\\r\\nlearning that Lucy was married to another, that Edward was free, to\\r\\nthe moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly\\r\\nfollowed, she was every thing by turns but tranquil. But when the\\r\\nsecond moment had passed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude\\r\\nremoved, compared her situation with what so lately it had been,--saw\\r\\nhim honourably released from his former engagement,--saw him instantly\\r\\nprofiting by the release, to address herself and declare an affection\\r\\nas tender, as constant as she had ever supposed it to be,--she was\\r\\noppressed, she was overcome by her own felicity; and happily disposed\\r\\nas is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the\\r\\nbetter, it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits,\\r\\nor any degree of tranquillity to her heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;--for whatever\\r\\nother claims might be made on him, it was impossible that less than a\\r\\nweek should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor\\'s company, or\\r\\nsuffice to say half that was to be said of the past, the present, and\\r\\nthe future;--for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of\\r\\nincessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in\\r\\ncommon between any two rational creatures, yet with lovers it is\\r\\ndifferent. Between _them_ no subject is finished, no communication is\\r\\neven made, till it has been made at least twenty times over.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy\\'s marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all,\\r\\nformed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;--and\\r\\nElinor\\'s particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in\\r\\nevery view, as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable\\r\\ncircumstances she had ever heard. How they could be thrown together,\\r\\nand by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl, of\\r\\nwhose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any\\r\\nadmiration,--a girl too already engaged to his brother, and on whose\\r\\naccount that brother had been thrown off by his family--it was beyond\\r\\nher comprehension to make out. To her own heart it was a delightful\\r\\naffair, to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but to her\\r\\nreason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward could only attempt an explanation by supposing, that, perhaps,\\r\\nat first accidentally meeting, the vanity of the one had been so\\r\\nworked on by the flattery of the other, as to lead by degrees to all\\r\\nthe rest. Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street,\\r\\nof his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother\\'s affairs\\r\\nmight have done, if applied to in time. She repeated it to Edward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_That_ was exactly like Robert,\" was his immediate observation. \"And\\r\\n_that_,\" he presently added, \"might perhaps be in _his_ head when the\\r\\nacquaintance between them first began. And Lucy perhaps at first might\\r\\nthink only of procuring his good offices in my favour. Other designs\\r\\nmight afterward arise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long it had been carrying on between them, however, he was equally\\r\\nat a loss with herself to make out; for at Oxford, where he had\\r\\nremained for choice ever since his quitting London, he had had no\\r\\nmeans of hearing of her but from herself, and her letters to the very\\r\\nlast were neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual. Not\\r\\nthe smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred to prepare him\\r\\nfor what followed;--and when at last it burst on him in a letter from\\r\\nLucy herself, he had been for some time, he believed, half stupified\\r\\nbetween the wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance. He\\r\\nput the letter into Elinor\\'s hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR SIR,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Being very sure I have long lost your affections, I have\\r\\n     thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another, and\\r\\n     have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to\\r\\n     think I might be with you; but I scorn to accept a hand\\r\\n     while the heart was another\\'s. Sincerely wish you happy in\\r\\n     your choice, and it shall not be my fault if we are not\\r\\n     always good friends, as our near relationship now makes\\r\\n     proper. I can safely say I owe you no ill-will, and am sure\\r\\n     you will be too generous to do us any ill offices. Your\\r\\n     brother has gained my affections entirely, and as we could\\r\\n     not live without one another, we are just returned from the\\r\\n     altar, and are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks,\\r\\n     which place your dear brother has great curiosity to see,\\r\\n     but thought I would first trouble you with these few lines,\\r\\n     and shall always remain--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Your sincere well-wisher, friend, and sister,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"LUCY FERRARS.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I have burnt all your letters, and will return your picture\\r\\n     the first opportunity. Please to destroy my scrawls--but the\\r\\n     ring with my hair you are very welcome to keep.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor read and returned it without any comment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition,\" said Edward.\\r\\n\"For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by _you_ in\\r\\nformer days. In a sister it is bad enough, but in a wife! how I have\\r\\nblushed over the pages of her writing! and I believe I may say that\\r\\nsince the first half year of our foolish business this is the only\\r\\nletter I ever received from her, of which the substance made me any\\r\\namends for the defect of the style.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"However it may have come about,\" said Elinor, after a pause,--\"they\\r\\nare certainly married. And your mother has brought on herself a most\\r\\nappropriate punishment. The independence she settled on Robert,\\r\\nthrough resentment against you, has put it in his power to make his\\r\\nown choice; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand\\r\\na-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for\\r\\nintending to do. She will hardly be less hurt, I suppose, by Robert\\'s\\r\\nmarrying Lucy, than she would have been by your marrying her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She will be more hurt by it, for Robert always was her favourite. She\\r\\nwill be more hurt by it, and on the same principle will forgive him\\r\\nmuch sooner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn what state the affair stood at present between them, Edward knew\\r\\nnot, for no communication with any of his family had yet been\\r\\nattempted by him. He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours\\r\\nafter Lucy\\'s letter arrived, and with only one object before him, the\\r\\nnearest road to Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of\\r\\nconduct, with which that road did not hold the most intimate\\r\\nconnection. He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with\\r\\nMiss Dashwood; and by his rapidity in seeking _that_ fate, it is to be\\r\\nsupposed, in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of\\r\\nColonel Brandon, in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own\\r\\ndeserts, and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts, he did\\r\\nnot, upon the whole, expect a very cruel reception. It was his\\r\\nbusiness, however, to say that he _did_, and he said it very prettily.\\r\\nWhat he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after, must be referred\\r\\nto the imagination of husbands and wives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off with a flourish of\\r\\nmalice against him in her message by Thomas, was perfectly clear to\\r\\nElinor; and Edward himself, now thoroughly enlightened on her\\r\\ncharacter, had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost\\r\\nmeanness of wanton ill-nature. Though his eyes had been long opened,\\r\\neven before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to her ignorance and a\\r\\nwant of liberality in some of her opinions, they had been equally\\r\\nimputed, by him, to her want of education; and till her last letter\\r\\nreached him, he had always believed her to be a well-disposed,\\r\\ngood-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself. Nothing but\\r\\nsuch a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an\\r\\nengagement, which, long before the discovery of it laid him open to\\r\\nhis mother\\'s anger, had been a continual source of disquiet and regret\\r\\nto him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought it my duty,\" said he, \"independent of my feelings, to give\\r\\nher the option of continuing the engagement or not, when I was\\r\\nrenounced by my mother, and stood to all appearance without a friend\\r\\nin the world to assist me. In such a situation as that, where there\\r\\nseemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living\\r\\ncreature, how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly\\r\\ninsisted on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing but\\r\\nthe most disinterested affection was her inducement? And even now, I\\r\\ncannot comprehend on what motive she acted, or what fancied advantage\\r\\nit could be to her, to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the\\r\\nsmallest regard, and who had only two thousand pounds in the world.\\r\\nShe could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour;\\r\\nthat your own family might in time relent. And at any rate, she lost\\r\\nnothing by continuing the engagement, for she has proved that it\\r\\nfettered neither her inclination nor her actions. The connection was\\r\\ncertainly a respectable one, and probably gained her consideration\\r\\namong her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred, it\\r\\nwould be better for her to marry _you_ than be single.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward was, of course, immediately convinced that nothing could have\\r\\nbeen more natural than Lucy\\'s conduct, nor more self-evident than the\\r\\nmotive of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor scolded him, harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence\\r\\nwhich compliments themselves, for having spent so much time with them\\r\\nat Norland, when he must have felt his own inconstancy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your behaviour was certainly very wrong,\" said she; \"because--to say\\r\\nnothing of my own conviction, our relations were all led away by it to\\r\\nfancy and expect _what_, as you were _then_ situated, could never be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could only plead an ignorance of his own heart, and a mistaken\\r\\nconfidence in the force of his engagement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was simple enough to think, that because my _faith_ was plighted to\\r\\nanother, there could be no danger in my being with you; and that the\\r\\nconsciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred\\r\\nas my honour. I felt that I admired you, but I told myself it was only\\r\\nfriendship; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and\\r\\nLucy, I did not know how far I was got. After that, I suppose, I _was_\\r\\nwrong in remaining so much in Sussex, and the arguments with which I\\r\\nreconciled myself to the expediency of it, were no better than\\r\\nthese:--The danger is my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but\\r\\nmyself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor smiled, and shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon\\'s being expected at the\\r\\nCottage, as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with\\r\\nhim, but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer\\r\\nresented his giving him the living of Delaford--\"Which, at present,\"\\r\\nsaid he, \"after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the\\r\\noccasion, he must think I have never forgiven him for offering.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Now_ he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the\\r\\nplace. But so little interest had he taken in the matter, that he owed\\r\\nall his knowledge of the house, garden, and glebe, extent of the\\r\\nparish, condition of the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor\\r\\nherself, who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon, and heard\\r\\nit with so much attention, as to be entirely mistress of the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne question after this only remained undecided, between them, one\\r\\ndifficulty only was to be overcome. They were brought together by\\r\\nmutual affection, with the warmest approbation of their real friends;\\r\\ntheir intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness\\r\\ncertain--and they only wanted something to live upon. Edward had two\\r\\nthousand pounds, and Elinor one, which, with Delaford living, was all\\r\\nthat they could call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs.\\r\\nDashwood should advance anything; and they were neither of them quite\\r\\nenough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-year\\r\\nwould supply them with the comforts of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his\\r\\nmother towards him; and on _that_ he rested for the residue of their\\r\\nincome. But Elinor had no such dependence; for since Edward would\\r\\nstill be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his choosing herself had\\r\\nbeen spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars\\'s flattering language as only a lesser\\r\\nevil than his choosing Lucy Steele, she feared that Robert\\'s offence\\r\\nwould serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout four days after Edward\\'s arrival Colonel Brandon appeared, to\\r\\ncomplete Mrs. Dashwood\\'s satisfaction, and to give her the dignity of\\r\\nhaving, for the first time since her living at Barton, more company\\r\\nwith her than her house would hold. Edward was allowed to retain the\\r\\nprivilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every\\r\\nnight to his old quarters at the Park; from whence he usually returned\\r\\nin the morning, early enough to interrupt the lovers\\' first\\r\\ntete-a-tete before breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nA three weeks\\' residence at Delaford, where, in his evening hours at\\r\\nleast, he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between\\r\\nthirty-six and seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind\\r\\nwhich needed all the improvement in Marianne\\'s looks, all the kindness\\r\\nof her welcome, and all the encouragement of her mother\\'s language, to\\r\\nmake it cheerful. Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he\\r\\ndid revive. No rumour of Lucy\\'s marriage had yet reached him:--he knew\\r\\nnothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his visit were\\r\\nconsequently spent in hearing and in wondering. Every thing was\\r\\nexplained to him by Mrs. Dashwood, and he found fresh reason to\\r\\nrejoice in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it\\r\\npromoted the interest of Elinor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced in the good\\r\\nopinion of each other, as they advanced in each other\\'s acquaintance,\\r\\nfor it could not be otherwise. Their resemblance in good principles\\r\\nand good sense, in disposition and manner of thinking, would probably\\r\\nhave been sufficient to unite them in friendship, without any other\\r\\nattraction; but their being in love with two sisters, and two sisters\\r\\nfond of each other, made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,\\r\\nwhich might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letters from town, which a few days before would have made every\\r\\nnerve in Elinor\\'s body thrill with transport, now arrived to be read\\r\\nwith less emotion than mirth. Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the\\r\\nwonderful tale, to vent her honest indignation against the jilting\\r\\ngirl, and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she\\r\\nwas sure, had quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now, by\\r\\nall accounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford. \"I do think,\" she\\r\\ncontinued, \"nothing was ever carried on so sly; for it was but two\\r\\ndays before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me. Not a soul\\r\\nsuspected anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul! came\\r\\ncrying to me the day after, in a great fright for fear of Mrs.\\r\\nFerrars, as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy it\\r\\nseems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married, on\\r\\npurpose we suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not seven\\r\\nshillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give her five guineas\\r\\nto take her down to Exeter, where she thinks of staying three or four\\r\\nweeks with Mrs. Burgess, in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the\\r\\nDoctor again. And I must say that Lucy\\'s crossness not to take them\\r\\nalong with them in the chaise is worse than all. Poor Mr. Edward! I\\r\\ncannot get him out of my head, but you must send for him to Barton,\\r\\nand Miss Marianne must try to comfort him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dashwood\\'s strains were more solemn. Mrs. Ferrars was the most\\r\\nunfortunate of women--poor Fanny had suffered agonies of\\r\\nsensibility--and he considered the existence of each, under such a\\r\\nblow, with grateful wonder. Robert\\'s offence was unpardonable, but\\r\\nLucy\\'s was infinitely worse. Neither of them were ever again to be\\r\\nmentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even, if she might hereafter be induced\\r\\nto forgive her son, his wife should never be acknowledged as her\\r\\ndaughter, nor be permitted to appear in her presence. The secrecy with\\r\\nwhich everything had been carried on between them, was rationally\\r\\ntreated as enormously heightening the crime, because, had any\\r\\nsuspicion of it occurred to the others, proper measures would have\\r\\nbeen taken to prevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join\\r\\nwith him in regretting that Lucy\\'s engagement with Edward had not\\r\\nrather been fulfilled, than that she should thus be the means of\\r\\nspreading misery farther in the family. He thus continued:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward\\'s name, which does not\\r\\nsurprise us; but, to our great astonishment, not a line has been\\r\\nreceived from him on the occasion. Perhaps, however, he is kept silent\\r\\nby his fear of offending, and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by\\r\\na line to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter of proper\\r\\nsubmission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny, and by her shown to\\r\\nher mother, might not be taken amiss; for we all know the tenderness\\r\\nof Mrs. Ferrars\\'s heart, and that she wishes for nothing so much as to\\r\\nbe on good terms with her children.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of\\r\\nEdward. It determined him to attempt a reconciliation, though not\\r\\nexactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A letter of proper submission!\" repeated he; \"would they have me beg\\r\\nmy mother\\'s pardon for Robert\\'s ingratitude to _her_, and breach of\\r\\nhonour to _me_? I can make no submission. I am grown neither humble\\r\\nnor penitent by what has passed. I am grown very happy; but that would\\r\\nnot interest. I know of no submission that _is_ proper for me to\\r\\nmake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may certainly ask to be forgiven,\" said Elinor, \"because you have\\r\\noffended;--and I should think you might _now_ venture so far as to\\r\\nprofess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew\\r\\non you your mother\\'s anger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe agreed that he might.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility may be\\r\\nconvenient while acknowledging a second engagement, almost as\\r\\nimprudent in _her_ eyes as the first.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had nothing to urge against it, but still resisted the idea of a\\r\\nletter of proper submission; and therefore, to make it easier to him,\\r\\nas he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by\\r\\nword of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that, instead of writing\\r\\nto Fanny, he should go to London, and personally entreat her good\\r\\noffices in his favour. \"And if they really _do_ interest themselves,\"\\r\\nsaid Marianne, in her new character of candour, \"in bringing about a\\r\\nreconciliation, I shall think that even John and Fanny are not\\r\\nentirely without merit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a visit on Colonel Brandon\\'s side of only three or four days,\\r\\nthe two gentlemen quitted Barton together. They were to go immediately\\r\\nto Delaford, that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his\\r\\nfuture home, and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what\\r\\nimprovements were needed to it; and from thence, after staying there a\\r\\ncouple of nights, he was to proceed on his journey to town.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER L\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars, just so violent\\r\\nand so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always\\r\\nseemed fearful of incurring, the reproach of being too amiable, Edward\\r\\nwas admitted to her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating. For many years of\\r\\nher life she had had two sons; but the crime and annihilation of\\r\\nEdward a few weeks ago, had robbed her of one; the similar\\r\\nannihilation of Robert had left her for a fortnight without any; and\\r\\nnow, by the resuscitation of Edward, she had one again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of his being allowed once more to live, however, he did not\\r\\nfeel the continuance of his existence secure, till he had revealed his\\r\\npresent engagement; for the publication of that circumstance, he\\r\\nfeared, might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry him\\r\\noff as rapidly as before. With apprehensive caution therefore it was\\r\\nrevealed, and he was listened to with unexpected calmness. Mrs.\\r\\nFerrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying\\r\\nMiss Dashwood, by every argument in her power; told him, that in Miss\\r\\nMorton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune; and\\r\\nenforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter\\r\\nof a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was\\r\\nonly the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than _three_;\\r\\nbut when she found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her\\r\\nrepresentation, he was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she\\r\\njudged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submit; and\\r\\ntherefore, after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own\\r\\ndignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will, she\\r\\nissued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next\\r\\nto be considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was\\r\\nnow her only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was\\r\\ninevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallest\\r\\nobjection was made against Edward\\'s taking orders for the sake of two\\r\\nhundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for\\r\\nthe present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had\\r\\nbeen given with Fanny.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was as much, however, as was desired, and more than was expected,\\r\\nby Edward and Elinor; and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling\\r\\nexcuses, seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them,\\r\\nthey had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the\\r\\nliving, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with\\r\\nan eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making\\r\\nconsiderable improvements; and after waiting some time for their\\r\\ncompletion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments\\r\\nand delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,\\r\\nas usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying\\r\\ntill every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton\\r\\nchurch early in the autumn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at\\r\\nthe Mansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of\\r\\nthe Parsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the\\r\\nspot;--could choose papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.\\r\\nMrs. Jennings\\'s prophecies, though rather jumbled together, were\\r\\nchiefly fulfilled; for she was able to visit Edward and his wife in\\r\\ntheir Parsonage by Michaelmas, and she found in Elinor and her\\r\\nhusband, as she really believed, one of the happiest couples in the\\r\\nworld. They had in fact nothing to wish for, but the marriage of\\r\\nColonel Brandon and Marianne, and rather better pasturage for their\\r\\ncows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were visited on their first settling by almost all their\\r\\nrelations and friends. Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness\\r\\nwhich she was almost ashamed of having authorised; and even the\\r\\nDashwoods were at the expense of a journey from Sussex to do them\\r\\nhonour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,\" said John, as\\r\\nthey were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford\\r\\nHouse, \"_that_ would be saying too much, for certainly you have been\\r\\none of the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is. But, I\\r\\nconfess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon\\r\\nbrother. His property here, his place, his house,--every thing is in\\r\\nsuch respectable and excellent condition! And his woods,--I have not\\r\\nseen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in\\r\\nDelaford Hanger! And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly\\r\\nthe person to attract him, yet I think it would altogether be\\r\\nadvisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as\\r\\nColonel Brandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what may\\r\\nhappen; for, when people are much thrown together, and see little of\\r\\nanybody else,--and it will always be in your power to set her off to\\r\\nadvantage, and so forth. In short, you may as well give her a chance;\\r\\nYou understand me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though Mrs. Ferrars _did_ come to see them, and always treated\\r\\nthem with the make-believe of decent affection, they were never\\r\\ninsulted by her real favour and preference. _That_ was due to the\\r\\nfolly of Robert, and the cunning of his wife; and it was earned by\\r\\nthem before many months had passed away. The selfish sagacity of the\\r\\nlatter, which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the\\r\\nprincipal instrument of his deliverance from it; for her respectful\\r\\nhumility, assiduous attentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the\\r\\nsmallest opening was given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars\\r\\nto his choice, and re-established him completely in her favour.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Everything in such respectable condition_]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole of Lucy\\'s behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which\\r\\ncrowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging\\r\\ninstance of what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest,\\r\\nhowever its progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing\\r\\nevery advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time\\r\\nand conscience. When Robert first sought her acquaintance, and\\r\\nprivately visited her in Bartlett\\'s Buildings, it was only with the\\r\\nview imputed to him by his brother. He merely meant to persuade her to\\r\\ngive up the engagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but\\r\\nthe affection of both, he naturally expected that one or two\\r\\ninterviews would settle the matter. In that point, however, and that\\r\\nonly, he erred; for though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence\\r\\nwould convince her in _time_, another visit, another conversation, was\\r\\nalways wanted to produce this conviction. Some doubts always lingered\\r\\nin her mind when they parted, which could only be removed by another\\r\\nhalf hour\\'s discourse with himself. His attendance was by this means\\r\\nsecured, and the rest followed in course. Instead of talking of\\r\\nEdward, they came gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on\\r\\nwhich he had always more to say than on any other, and in which she\\r\\nsoon betrayed an interest even equal to his own; and in short, it\\r\\nbecame speedily evident to both, that he had entirely supplanted his\\r\\nbrother. He was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and\\r\\nvery proud of marrying privately without his mother\\'s consent. What\\r\\nimmediately followed is known. They passed some months in great\\r\\nhappiness at Dawlish; for she had many relations and old acquaintances\\r\\nto cut--and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages; and from\\r\\nthence returning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by\\r\\nthe simple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucy\\'s instigation, was\\r\\nadopted. The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable,\\r\\ncomprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty\\r\\nand therefore could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks\\r\\nlonger unpardoned. But perseverance in humility of conduct and\\r\\nmessages, in self-condemnation for Robert\\'s offence, and gratitude for\\r\\nthe unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the haughty\\r\\nnotice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon\\r\\nafterwards, by rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and\\r\\ninfluence. Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert\\r\\nor Fanny; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having\\r\\nonce intended to marry her, and Elinor, though superior to her in\\r\\nfortune and birth, was spoken of as an intruder, _she_ was in every\\r\\nthing considered, and always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite\\r\\nchild. They settled in town, received very liberal assistance from\\r\\nMrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods;\\r\\nand setting aside the jealousies and ill-will continually subsisting\\r\\nbetween Fanny and Lucy, in which their husbands of course took a part,\\r\\nas well as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy\\r\\nthemselves, nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have\\r\\npuzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed\\r\\nto it, might have puzzled them still more. It was an arrangement,\\r\\nhowever, justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing\\r\\never appeared in Robert\\'s style of living or of talking to give a\\r\\nsuspicion of his regretting the extent of his income, as either\\r\\nleaving his brother too little, or bringing himself too much;--and if\\r\\nEdward might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every\\r\\nparticular, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home,\\r\\nand from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed\\r\\nno less contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an\\r\\nexchange.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor\\'s marriage divided her as little from her family as could well\\r\\nbe contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely\\r\\nuseless, for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their\\r\\ntime with her. Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well\\r\\nas pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford; for her wish\\r\\nof bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less\\r\\nearnest, though rather more liberal than what John had expressed. It\\r\\nwas now her darling object. Precious as was the company of her\\r\\ndaughter to her, she desired nothing so much as to give up its\\r\\nconstant enjoyment to her valued friend; and to see Marianne settled\\r\\nat the mansion-house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor. They\\r\\neach felt his sorrows, and their own obligations, and Marianne, by\\r\\ngeneral consent, was to be the reward of all.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such a confederacy against her--with a knowledge so intimate of\\r\\nhis goodness--with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself,\\r\\nwhich at last, though long after it was observable to everybody\\r\\nelse--burst on her--what could she do?\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate. She was born to\\r\\ndiscover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her\\r\\nconduct, her most favourite maxims. She was born to overcome an\\r\\naffection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no\\r\\nsentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily\\r\\nto give her hand to another!--and _that_ other, a man who had suffered\\r\\nno less than herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two\\r\\nyears before, she had considered too old to be married,--and who still\\r\\nsought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut so it was. Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible\\r\\npassion, as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting,\\r\\ninstead of remaining even for ever with her mother, and finding her\\r\\nonly pleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her more calm\\r\\nand sober judgment she had determined on,--she found herself at\\r\\nnineteen, submitting to new attachments, entering on new duties,\\r\\nplaced in a new home, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the\\r\\npatroness of a village.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him,\\r\\nbelieved he deserved to be;--in Marianne he was consoled for every\\r\\npast affliction;--her regard and her society restored his mind to\\r\\nanimation, and his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found\\r\\nher own happiness in forming his, was equally the persuasion and\\r\\ndelight of each observing friend. Marianne could never love by halves;\\r\\nand her whole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband,\\r\\nas it had once been to Willoughby.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilloughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his\\r\\npunishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness\\r\\nof Mrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character,\\r\\nas the source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had\\r\\nhe behaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been\\r\\nhappy and rich. That his repentance of misconduct, which thus brought\\r\\nits own punishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;--nor that he\\r\\nlong thought of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with\\r\\nregret. But that he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from\\r\\nsociety, or contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a\\r\\nbroken heart, must not be depended on--for he did neither. He lived to\\r\\nexert, and frequently to enjoy himself. His wife was not always out of\\r\\nhumour, nor his home always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses\\r\\nand dogs, and in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable\\r\\ndegree of domestic felicity.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Marianne, however, in spite of his incivility in surviving her\\r\\nloss, he always retained that decided regard which interested him in\\r\\nevery thing that befell her, and made her his secret standard of\\r\\nperfection in woman; and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him\\r\\nin after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, without\\r\\nattempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and\\r\\nMrs. Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them, Margaret had\\r\\nreached an age highly suitable for dancing, and not very ineligible\\r\\nfor being supposed to have a lover.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communication\\r\\nwhich strong family affection would naturally dictate;--and among the\\r\\nmerits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked\\r\\nas the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost\\r\\nwithin sight of each other, they could live without disagreement\\r\\nbetween themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE END\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Sense and Sensibility, by Jane Austen\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SENSE AND SENSIBILITY ***\\r\\n\\r\\n***** This file should be named 21839.txt or 21839.zip *****\\r\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\r\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/8/3/21839/\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Fritz Ohrenschall and Sankar Viswanathan (This\\r\\nbook was produced from scanned images of public domain\\r\\nmaterial from the Google Print project.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\r\\nwill be renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\r\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\r\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\r\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

This version is believed to be the most\\r\\nfaithful rendition into English of this classic currently in the\\r\\npublic domain. The few notes of the translator are located near the\\r\\npoint where they are referenced. The Runic characters in Chapter III\\r\\nare visible in the HTML version of the text. The character set is\\r\\nISO-8891-1, mainly the Windows character set. The translation is by\\r\\nFrederick Amadeus Malleson.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the translation is fairly literal, and Malleson (a clergyman)\\r\\nhas taken pains with the scientific portions of the work and added\\r\\nthe chapter headings, he has made some unfortunate emendations mainly\\r\\nconcerning biblical references, and has added a few \\'improvements\\' of\\r\\nhis own, which are detailed below:\\r\\n\\r\\nIII. \"_pertubata seu inordinata,_\" as Euclid has it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nXXX. cry, \"Thalatta! thalatta!\" the sea! the sea!

(footnote), and which is illustrated in the negro\\r\\ncountenance and in the lowest savages.\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXIX. of the geologic period. {antediluvian}\\r\\n\\r\\n(These corrections have kindly been pointed out by Christian Sanchez\\r\\n<chvsanchez@arnet.com.ar> of the Jules Verne Forum.)]\\r\\n\\r\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\n                              A JOURNEY\\r\\n\\r\\n                               INTO THE\\r\\n\\r\\n                        INTERIOR OF THE EARTH\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  by\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Jules Verne\\r\\n\\r\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPREFACE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE \"Voyages Extraordinaires\" of M. Jules Verne deserve to be made\\r\\nwidely known in English-speaking countries by means of carefully\\r\\nprepared translations. Witty and ingenious adaptations of the\\r\\nresearches and discoveries of modern science to the popular taste,\\r\\nwhich demands that these should be presented to ordinary readers in\\r\\nthe lighter form of cleverly mingled truth and fiction, these books\\r\\nwill assuredly be read with profit and delight, especially by English\\r\\nyouth. Certainly no writer before M. Jules Verne has been so happy in\\r\\nweaving together in judicious combination severe scientific truth\\r\\nwith a charming exercise of playful imagination.\\r\\n\\r\\nIceland, the starting point of the marvellous underground journey\\r\\nimagined in this volume, is invested at the present time with a\\r\\npainful interest in consequence of the disastrous eruptions last\\r\\nEaster Day, which covered with lava and ashes the poor and scanty\\r\\nvegetation upon which four thousand persons were partly dependent for\\r\\nthe means of subsistence. For a long time to come the natives of that\\r\\ninteresting island, who cleave to their desert home with all that\\r\\n_amor patriae_ which is so much more easily understood than\\r\\nexplained, will look, and look not in vain, for the help of those on\\r\\nwhom fall the smiles of a kindlier sun in regions not torn by\\r\\nearthquakes nor blasted and ravaged by volcanic fires. Will the\\r\\nreaders of this little book, who, are gifted with the means of\\r\\nindulging in the luxury of extended beneficence, remember the\\r\\ndistress of their brethren in the far north, whom distance has not\\r\\nbarred from the claim of being counted our \"neighbours\"? And whatever\\r\\ntheir humane feelings may prompt them to bestow will be gladly added\\r\\nto the Mansion-House Iceland Relief Fund.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his desire to ascertain how far the picture of Iceland, drawn in\\r\\nthe work of Jules Verne is a correct one, the translator hopes in the\\r\\ncourse of a mail or two to receive a communication from a leading man\\r\\nof science in the island, which may furnish matter for additional\\r\\ninformation in a future edition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scientific portion of the French original is not without a few\\r\\nerrors, which the translator, with the kind assistance of Mr. Cameron\\r\\nof H. M. Geological Survey, has ventured to point out and correct. It\\r\\nis scarcely to be expected in a work in which the element of\\r\\namusement is intended to enter more largely than that of scientific\\r\\ninstruction, that any great degree of accuracy should be arrived at.\\r\\nYet the translator hopes that what trifling deviations from the text\\r\\nor corrections in foot notes he is responsible for, will have done a\\r\\nlittle towards the increased usefulness of the work.\\r\\n\\r\\nF.

Liedenbrock so soon!\" cried poor Martha in great alarm, half\\r\\nopening the dining-room door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Martha; but very likely the dinner is not half cooked, for it\\r\\nis not two yet. Saint Michael\\'s clock has only just struck half-past\\r\\none.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then why has the master come home so soon?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps he will tell us that himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here he is, Monsieur Axel; I will run and hide myself while you\\r\\nargue with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Martha retreated in safety into her own dominions.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was left alone. But how was it possible for a man of my undecided\\r\\nturn of mind to argue successfully with so irascible a person as the\\r\\nProfessor? With this persuasion I was hurrying away to my own little\\r\\nretreat upstairs, when the street door creaked upon its hinges; heavy\\r\\nfeet made the whole flight of stairs to shake; and the master of the\\r\\nhouse, passing rapidly through the dining-room, threw himself in\\r\\nhaste into his own sanctum.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on his rapid way he had found time to fling his hazel stick into\\r\\na corner, his rough broadbrim upon the table, and these few emphatic\\r\\nwords at his nephew:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Axel, follow me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had scarcely had time to move when the Professor was again shouting\\r\\nafter me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! not come yet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I rushed into my redoubtable master\\'s study.\\r\\n\\r\\nOtto Liedenbrock had no mischief in him, I willingly allow that; but\\r\\nunless he very considerably changes as he grows older, at the end he\\r\\nwill be a most original character.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was professor at the Johannaeum, and was delivering a series of\\r\\nlectures on mineralogy, in the course of every one of which he broke\\r\\ninto a passion once or twice at least. Not at all that he was\\r\\nover-anxious about the improvement of his class, or about the degree\\r\\nof attention with which they listened to him, or the success which\\r\\nmight eventually crown his labours. Such little matters of detail\\r\\nnever troubled him much. His teaching was as the German philosophy\\r\\ncalls it, \\'subjective\\'; it was to benefit himself, not others. He was\\r\\na learned egotist. He was a well of science, and the pulleys worked\\r\\nuneasily when you wanted to draw anything out of it. In a word, he\\r\\nwas a learned miser.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany has not a few professors of this sort.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo his misfortune, my uncle was not gifted with a sufficiently rapid\\r\\nutterance; not, to be sure, when he was talking at home, but\\r\\ncertainly in his public delivery; this is a want much to be deplored\\r\\nin a speaker. The fact is, that during the course of his lectures at\\r\\nthe Johannaeum, the Professor often came to a complete standstill; he\\r\\nfought with wilful words that refused to pass his struggling lips,\\r\\nsuch words as resist and distend the cheeks, and at last break out\\r\\ninto the unasked-for shape of a round and most unscientific oath:\\r\\nthen his fury would gradually abate.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow in mineralogy there are many half-Greek and half-Latin terms,\\r\\nvery hard to articulate, and which would be most trying to a poet\\'s\\r\\nmeasures. I don\\'t wish to say a word against so respectable a\\r\\nscience, far be that from me. True, in the august presence of\\r\\nrhombohedral crystals, retinasphaltic resins, gehlenites, Fassaites,\\r\\nmolybdenites, tungstates of manganese, and titanite of zirconium,\\r\\nwhy, the most facile of tongues may make a slip now and then.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt therefore happened that this venial fault of my uncle\\'s came to be\\r\\npretty well understood in time, and an unfair advantage was taken of\\r\\nit; the students laid wait for him in dangerous places, and when he\\r\\nbegan to stumble, loud was the laughter, which is not in good taste,\\r\\nnot even in Germans. And if there was always a full audience to\\r\\nhonour the Liedenbrock courses, I should be sorry to conjecture how\\r\\nmany came to make merry at my uncle\\'s expense.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless my good uncle was a man of deep learning--a fact I am\\r\\nmost anxious to assert and reassert. Sometimes he might irretrievably\\r\\ninjure a specimen by his too great ardour in handling it; but still\\r\\nhe united the genius of a true geologist with the keen eye of the\\r\\nmineralogist. Armed with his hammer, his steel pointer, his magnetic\\r\\nneedles, his blowpipe, and his bottle of nitric acid, he was a\\r\\npowerful man of science. He would refer any mineral to its proper\\r\\nplace among the six hundred [1] elementary substances now enumerated,\\r\\nby its fracture, its appearance, its hardness, its fusibility, its\\r\\nsonorousness, its smell, and its taste.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name of Liedenbrock was honourably mentioned in colleges and\\r\\nlearned societies. Humphry Davy, [2] Humboldt, Captain Sir John\\r\\nFranklin, General Sabine, never failed to call upon him on their way\\r\\nthrough Hamburg. Becquerel, Ebelman, Brewster, Dumas, Milne-Edwards,\\r\\nSaint-Claire-Deville frequently consulted him upon the most difficult\\r\\nproblems in chemistry, a science which was indebted to him for\\r\\nconsiderable discoveries, for in 1853 there had appeared at Leipzig\\r\\nan imposing folio by Otto Liedenbrock, entitled, \"A Treatise upon\\r\\nTranscendental Chemistry,\" with plates; a work, however, which failed\\r\\nto cover its expenses.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo all these titles to honour let me add that my uncle was the\\r\\ncurator of the museum of mineralogy formed by M. Struve, the Russian\\r\\nambassador; a most valuable collection, the fame of which is European.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was the gentleman who addressed me in that impetuous manner.\\r\\nFancy a tall, spare man, of an iron constitution, and with a fair\\r\\ncomplexion which took off a good ten years from the fifty he must own\\r\\nto. His restless eyes were in incessant motion behind his full-sized\\r\\nspectacles. His long, thin nose was like a knife blade. Boys have\\r\\nbeen heard to remark that that organ was magnetised and attracted\\r\\niron filings. But this was merely a mischievous report; it had no\\r\\nattraction except for snuff, which it seemed to draw to itself in\\r\\ngreat quantities.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I have added, to complete my portrait, that my uncle walked by\\r\\nmathematical strides of a yard and a half, and that in walking he\\r\\nkept his fists firmly closed, a sure sign of an irritable\\r\\ntemperament, I think I shall have said enough to disenchant any one\\r\\nwho should by mistake have coveted much of his company.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe lived in his own little house in Koenigstrasse, a structure half\\r\\nbrick and half wood, with a gable cut into steps; it looked upon one\\r\\nof those winding canals which intersect each other in the middle of\\r\\nthe ancient quarter of Hamburg, and which the great fire of 1842 had\\r\\nfortunately spared.\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] Sixty-three. (Tr.)\\r\\n\\r\\n[2] As Sir Humphry Davy died in 1829, the translator must be pardoned\\r\\nfor pointing out here an anachronism, unless we are to assume that\\r\\nthe learned Professor\\'s celebrity dawned in his earliest years. (Tr.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is true that the old house stood slightly off the perpendicular,\\r\\nand bulged out a little towards the street; its roof sloped a little\\r\\nto one side, like the cap over the left ear of a Tugendbund student;\\r\\nits lines wanted accuracy; but after all, it stood firm, thanks to an\\r\\nold elm which buttressed it in front, and which often in spring sent\\r\\nits young sprays through the window panes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle was tolerably well off for a German professor. The house was\\r\\nhis own, and everything in it. The living contents were his\\r\\ngod-daughter Graeuben, a young Virlandaise of seventeen, Martha, and\\r\\nmyself. As his nephew and an orphan, I became his laboratory\\r\\nassistant.\\r\\n\\r\\nI freely confess that I was exceedingly fond of geology and all its\\r\\nkindred sciences; the blood of a mineralogist was in my veins, and in\\r\\nthe midst of my specimens I was always happy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a word, a man might live happily enough in the little old house in\\r\\nthe Koenigstrasse, in spite of the restless impatience of its master,\\r\\nfor although he was a little too excitable--he was very fond of me.\\r\\nBut the man had no notion how to wait; nature herself was too slow\\r\\nfor him. In April, after he had planted in the terra-cotta pots\\r\\noutside his window seedling plants of mignonette and convolvulus, he\\r\\nwould go and give them a little pull by their leaves to make them\\r\\ngrow faster. In dealing with such a strange individual there was\\r\\nnothing for it but prompt obedience. I therefore rushed after him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II.\\r\\n\\r\\nA MYSTERY TO BE SOLVED AT ANY PRICE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat study of his was a museum, and nothing else. Specimens of\\r\\neverything known in mineralogy lay there in their places in perfect\\r\\norder, and correctly named, divided into inflammable, metallic, and\\r\\nlithoid minerals.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow well I knew all these bits of science! Many a time, instead of\\r\\nenjoying the company of lads of my own age, I had preferred dusting\\r\\nthese graphites, anthracites, coals, lignites, and peats! And there\\r\\nwere bitumens, resins, organic salts, to be protected from the least\\r\\ngrain of dust; and metals, from iron to gold, metals whose current\\r\\nvalue altogether disappeared in the presence of the republican\\r\\nequality of scientific specimens; and stones too, enough to rebuild\\r\\nentirely the house in Koenigstrasse, even with a handsome additional\\r\\nroom, which would have suited me admirably.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on entering this study now I thought of none of all these\\r\\nwonders; my uncle alone filled my thoughts. He had thrown himself\\r\\ninto a velvet easy-chair, and was grasping between his hands a book\\r\\nover which he bent, pondering with intense admiration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here\\'s a remarkable book! What a wonderful book!\" he was exclaiming.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese ejaculations brought to my mind the fact that my uncle was\\r\\nliable to occasional fits of bibliomania; but no old book had any\\r\\nvalue in his eyes unless it had the virtue of being nowhere else to\\r\\nbe found, or, at any rate, of being illegible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, now; don\\'t you see it yet? Why I have got a priceless\\r\\ntreasure, that I found his morning, in rummaging in old Hevelius\\'s\\r\\nshop, the Jew.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Magnificent!\" I replied, with a good imitation of enthusiasm.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was the good of all this fuss about an old quarto, bound in\\r\\nrough calf, a yellow, faded volume, with a ragged seal depending from\\r\\nit?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut for all that there was no lull yet in the admiring exclamations\\r\\nof the Professor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See,\" he went on, both asking the questions and supplying the\\r\\nanswers. \"Isn\\'t it a beauty? Yes; splendid! Did you ever see such a\\r\\nbinding? Doesn\\'t the book open easily? Yes; it stops open anywhere.\\r\\nBut does it shut equally well? Yes; for the binding and the leaves\\r\\nare flush, all in a straight line, and no gaps or openings anywhere.\\r\\nAnd look at its back, after seven hundred years. Why, Bozerian,\\r\\nCloss, or Purgold might have been proud of such a binding!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile rapidly making these comments my uncle kept opening and\\r\\nshutting the old tome. I really could do no less than ask a question\\r\\nabout its contents, although I did not feel the slightest interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what is the title of this marvellous work?\" I asked with an\\r\\naffected eagerness which he must have been very blind not to see\\r\\nthrough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This work,\" replied my uncle, firing up with renewed enthusiasm,\\r\\n\"this work is the Heims Kringla of Snorre Turlleson, the most famous\\r\\nIcelandic author of the twelfth century! It is the chronicle of the\\r\\nNorwegian princes who ruled in Iceland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed;\" I cried, keeping up wonderfully, \"of course it is a German\\r\\ntranslation?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What!\" sharply replied the Professor, \"a translation! What should I\\r\\ndo with a translation? This _is_ the Icelandic original, in the\\r\\nmagnificent idiomatic vernacular, which is both rich and simple, and\\r\\nadmits of an infinite variety of grammatical combinations and verbal\\r\\nmodifications.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Like German.\" I happily ventured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied my uncle, shrugging his shoulders; \"but, in addition\\r\\nto all this, the Icelandic has three numbers like the Greek, and\\r\\nirregular declensions of nouns proper like the Latin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said I, a little moved out of my indifference; \"and is the type\\r\\ngood?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Type! What do you mean by talking of type, wretched Axel? Type! Do\\r\\nyou take it for a printed book, you ignorant fool? It is a\\r\\nmanuscript, a Runic manuscript.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Runic?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. Do you want me to explain what that is?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course not,\" I replied in the tone of an injured man. But my\\r\\nuncle persevered, and told me, against my will, of many things I\\r\\ncared nothing about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Runic characters were in use in Iceland in former ages. They were\\r\\ninvented, it is said, by Odin himself. Look there, and wonder,\\r\\nimpious young man, and admire these letters, the invention of the\\r\\nScandinavian god!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, well! not knowing what to say, I was going to prostrate myself\\r\\nbefore this wonderful book, a way of answering equally pleasing to\\r\\ngods and kings, and which has the advantage of never giving them any\\r\\nembarrassment, when a little incident happened to divert conversation\\r\\ninto another channel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the appearance of a dirty slip of parchment, which slipped\\r\\nout of the volume and fell upon the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle pounced upon this shred with incredible avidity. An old\\r\\ndocument, enclosed an immemorial time within the folds of this old\\r\\nbook, had for him an immeasurable value.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s this?\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he laid out upon the table a piece of parchment, five inches by\\r\\nthree, and along which were traced certain mysterious characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is the exact facsimile. I think it important to let these\\r\\nstrange signs be publicly known, for they were the means of drawing\\r\\non Professor Liedenbrock and his nephew to undertake the most\\r\\nwonderful expedition of the nineteenth century.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Runic glyphs occur here]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Professor mused a few moments over this series of characters;\\r\\nthen raising his spectacles he pronounced:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These are Runic letters; they are exactly like those of the\\r\\nmanuscript of Snorre Turlleson. But, what on earth is their meaning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRunic letters appearing to my mind to be an invention of the learned\\r\\nto mystify this poor world, I was not sorry to see my uncle suffering\\r\\nthe pangs of mystification. At least, so it seemed to me, judging\\r\\nfrom his fingers, which were beginning to work with terrible energy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is certainly old Icelandic,\" he muttered between his teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Professor Liedenbrock must have known, for he was acknowledged to\\r\\nbe quite a polyglot. Not that he could speak fluently in the two\\r\\nthousand languages and twelve thousand dialects which are spoken on\\r\\nthe earth, but he knew at least his share of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he was going, in the presence of this difficulty, to give way to\\r\\nall the impetuosity of his character, and I was preparing for a\\r\\nviolent outbreak, when two o\\'clock struck by the little timepiece\\r\\nover the fireplace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment our good housekeeper Martha opened the study door,\\r\\nsaying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dinner is ready!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI am afraid he sent that soup to where it would boil away to nothing,\\r\\nand Martha took to her heels for safety. I followed her, and hardly\\r\\nknowing how I got there I found myself seated in my usual place.\\r\\n\\r\\nI waited a few minutes. No Professor came. Never within my\\r\\nremembrance had he missed the important ceremonial of dinner. And yet\\r\\nwhat a good dinner it was! There was parsley soup, an omelette of ham\\r\\ngarnished with spiced sorrel, a fillet of veal with compote of\\r\\nprunes; for dessert, crystallised fruit; the whole washed down with\\r\\nsweet Moselle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this my uncle was going to sacrifice to a bit of old parchment.\\r\\nAs an affectionate and attentive nephew I considered it my duty to\\r\\neat for him as well as for myself, which I did conscientiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have never known such a thing,\" said Martha. \"M. Liedenbrock is\\r\\nnot at table!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who could have believed it?\" I said, with my mouth full.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something serious is going to happen,\" said the servant, shaking her\\r\\nhead.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy opinion was, that nothing more serious would happen than an awful\\r\\nscene when my uncle should have discovered that his dinner was\\r\\ndevoured. I had come to the last of the fruit when a very loud voice\\r\\ntore me away from the pleasures of my dessert. With one spring I\\r\\nbounded out of the dining-room into the study.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RUNIC WRITING EXERCISES THE PROFESSOR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Undoubtedly it is Runic,\" said the Professor, bending his brows;\\r\\n\"but there is a secret in it, and I mean to discover the key.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA violent gesture finished the sentence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sit there,\" he added, holding out his fist towards the table. \"Sit\\r\\nthere, and write.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was seated in a trice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now I will dictate to you every letter of our alphabet which\\r\\ncorresponds with each of these Icelandic characters. We will see what\\r\\nthat will give us. But, by St. Michael, if you should dare to deceive\\r\\nme--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dictation commenced. I did my best. Every letter was given me one\\r\\nafter the other, with the following remarkable result:\\r\\n\\r\\n     mm.rnlls  esrevel  seecIde\\r\\n     sgtssmf   vnteief  niedrke\\r\\n     kt,samn   atrateS  saodrrn\\r\\n     emtnaeI   nvaect   rrilSa\\r\\n     Atsaar    .nvcrc   ieaabs\\r\\n     ccrmi     eevtVl   frAntv\\r\\n     dt,iac    oseibo   KediiI\\r\\n\\r\\n[Redactor: In the original version the initial letter is an \\'m\\' with\\r\\na superscore over it. It is my supposition that this is the\\r\\ntranslator\\'s way of writing \\'mm\\' and I have replaced it accordingly,\\r\\nsince our typography does not allow such a character.]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this work was ended my uncle tore the paper from me and examined\\r\\nit attentively for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does it all mean?\" he kept repeating mechanically.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon my honour I could not have enlightened him. Besides he did not\\r\\nask me, and he went on talking to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is what is called a cryptogram, or cipher,\" he said, \"in which\\r\\nletters are purposely thrown in confusion, which if properly arranged\\r\\nwould reveal their sense. Only think that under this jargon there may\\r\\nlie concealed the clue to some great discovery!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for me, I was of opinion that there was nothing at all, in it;\\r\\nthough, of course, I took care not to say so.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Professor took the book and the parchment, and diligently\\r\\ncompared them together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These two writings are not by the same hand,\" he said; \"the cipher\\r\\nis of later date than the book, an undoubted proof of which I see in\\r\\na moment. The first letter is a double m, a letter which is not to be\\r\\nfound in Turlleson\\'s book, and which was only added to the alphabet\\r\\nin the fourteenth century. Therefore there are two hundred years\\r\\nbetween the manuscript and the document.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI admitted that this was a strictly logical conclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am therefore led to imagine,\" continued my uncle, \"that some\\r\\npossessor of this book wrote these mysterious letters. But who was\\r\\nthat possessor? Is his name nowhere to be found in the manuscript?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle raised his spectacles, took up a strong lens, and carefully\\r\\nexamined the blank pages of the book. On the front of the second, the\\r\\ntitle-page, he noticed a sort of stain which looked like an ink blot.\\r\\nBut in looking at it very closely he thought he could distinguish\\r\\nsome half-effaced letters. My uncle at once fastened upon this as the\\r\\ncentre of interest, and he laboured at that blot, until by the help\\r\\nof his microscope he ended by making out the following Runic\\r\\ncharacters which he read without difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Arne Saknussemm!\" he cried in triumph. \"Why that is the name of\\r\\nanother Icelander, a savant of the sixteenth century, a celebrated\\r\\nalchemist!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI gazed at my uncle with satisfactory admiration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Those alchemists,\" he resumed, \"Avicenna, Bacon, Lully, Paracelsus,\\r\\nwere the real and only savants of their time. They made discoveries\\r\\nat which we are astonished. Has not this Saknussemm concealed under\\r\\nhis cryptogram some surprising invention? It is so; it must be so!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Professor\\'s imagination took fire at this hypothesis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No doubt,\" I ventured to reply, \"but what interest would he have in\\r\\nthus hiding so marvellous a discovery?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why? Why? How can I tell? Did not Galileo do the same by Saturn? We\\r\\nshall see. I will get at the secret of this document, and I will\\r\\nneither sleep nor eat until I have found it out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy comment on this was a half-suppressed \"Oh!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor you either, Axel,\" he added.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The deuce!\" said I to myself; \"then it is lucky I have eaten two\\r\\ndinners to-day!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"First of all we must find out the key to this cipher; that cannot be\\r\\ndifficult.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt these words I quickly raised my head; but my uncle went on\\r\\nsoliloquising.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s nothing easier. In this document there are a hundred and\\r\\nthirty-two letters, viz., seventy-seven consonants and fifty-five\\r\\nvowels. This is the proportion found in southern languages, whilst\\r\\nnorthern tongues are much richer in consonants; therefore this is in\\r\\na southern language.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were very fair conclusions, I thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what language is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere I looked for a display of learning, but I met instead with\\r\\nprofound analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This Saknussemm,\" he went on, \"was a very well-informed man; now\\r\\nsince he was not writing in his own mother tongue, he would naturally\\r\\nselect that which was currently adopted by the choice spirits of the\\r\\nsixteenth century; I mean Latin. If I am mistaken, I can but try\\r\\nSpanish, French, Italian, Greek, or Hebrew. But the savants of the\\r\\nsixteenth century generally wrote in Latin. I am therefore entitled\\r\\nto pronounce this, a priori, to be Latin. It is Latin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI jumped up in my chair. My Latin memories rose in revolt against the\\r\\nnotion that these barbarous words could belong to the sweet language\\r\\nof Virgil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it is Latin,\" my uncle went on; \"but it is Latin confused and\\r\\nin disorder; \"_pertubata seu inordinata,_\" as Euclid has it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well,\" thought I, \"if you can bring order out of that\\r\\nconfusion, my dear uncle, you are a clever man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us examine carefully,\" said he again, taking up the leaf upon\\r\\nwhich I had written. \"Here is a series of one hundred and thirty-two\\r\\nletters in apparent disorder. There are words consisting of\\r\\nconsonants only, as _nrrlls;_ others, on the other hand, in which\\r\\nvowels predominate, as for instance the fifth, _uneeief,_ or the last\\r\\nbut one, _oseibo_. Now this arrangement has evidently not been\\r\\npremeditated; it has arisen mathematically in obedience to the\\r\\nunknown law which has ruled in the succession of these letters. It\\r\\nappears to me a certainty that the original sentence was written in a\\r\\nproper manner, and afterwards distorted by a law which we have yet to\\r\\ndiscover. Whoever possesses the key of this cipher will read it with\\r\\nfluency. What is that key? Axel, have you got it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI answered not a word, and for a very good reason. My eyes had fallen\\r\\nupon a charming picture, suspended against the wall, the portrait of\\r\\nGraeuben. My uncle\\'s ward was at that time at Altona, staying with a\\r\\nrelation, and in her absence I was very downhearted; for I may\\r\\nconfess it to you now, the pretty Virlandaise and the professor\\'s\\r\\nnephew loved each other with a patience and a calmness entirely\\r\\nGerman. We had become engaged unknown to my uncle, who was too much\\r\\ntaken up with geology to be able to enter into such feelings as ours.\\r\\nGraeuben was a lovely blue-eyed blonde, rather given to gravity and\\r\\nseriousness; but that did not prevent her from loving me very\\r\\nsincerely. As for me, I adored her, if there is such a word in the\\r\\nGerman language. Thus it happened that the picture of my pretty\\r\\nVirlandaise threw me in a moment out of the world of realities into\\r\\nthat of memory and fancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere looked down upon me the faithful companion of my labours and my\\r\\nrecreations. Every day she helped me to arrange my uncle\\'s precious\\r\\nspecimens; she and I labelled them together. Mademoiselle Graeuben was\\r\\nan accomplished mineralogist; she could have taught a few things to a\\r\\nsavant. She was fond of investigating abstruse scientific questions.\\r\\nWhat pleasant hours we have spent in study; and how often I envied\\r\\nthe very stones which she handled with her charming fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, when our leisure hours came, we used to go out together and\\r\\nturn into the shady avenues by the Alster, and went happily side by\\r\\nside up to the old windmill, which forms such an improvement to the\\r\\nlandscape at the head of the lake. On the road we chatted hand in\\r\\nhand; I told her amusing tales at which she laughed heartily. Then we\\r\\nreached the banks of the Elbe, and after having bid good-bye to the\\r\\nswan, sailing gracefully amidst the white water lilies, we returned\\r\\nto the quay by the steamer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is just where I was in my dream, when my uncle with a vehement\\r\\nthump on the table dragged me back to the realities of life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" said he, \"the very first idea which would come into any one\\'s\\r\\nhead to confuse the letters of a sentence would be to write the words\\r\\nvertically instead of horizontally.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\" said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now we must see what would be the effect of that, Axel; put down\\r\\nupon this paper any sentence you like, only instead of arranging the\\r\\nletters in the usual way, one after the other, place them in\\r\\nsuccession in vertical columns, so as to group them together in five\\r\\nor six vertical lines.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI caught his meaning, and immediately produced the following literary\\r\\nwonder:\\r\\n\\r\\n     I       y       l       o       a       u\\r\\n     l       o       l       w       r       b\\r\\n     o       u       ,       n       G       e\\r\\n     v       w       m       d       r       n\\r\\n     e       e       y       e       a       !\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good,\" said the professor, without reading them, \"now set down those\\r\\nwords in a horizontal line.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI obeyed, and with this result:\\r\\n\\r\\n     Iyloau lolwrb ou,nGe vwmdrn eeyea!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excellent!\" said my uncle, taking the paper hastily out of my hands.\\r\\n\"This begins to look just like an ancient document: the vowels and\\r\\nthe consonants are grouped together in equal disorder; there are even\\r\\ncapitals in the middle of words, and commas too, just as in\\r\\nSaknussemm\\'s parchment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI considered these remarks very clever.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said my uncle, looking straight at me, \"to read the sentence\\r\\nwhich you have just written, and with which I am wholly unacquainted,\\r\\nI shall only have to take the first letter of each word, then the\\r\\nsecond, the third, and so forth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd my uncle, to his great astonishment, and my much greater, read:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I love you well, my own dear Graeuben!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hallo!\" cried the Professor.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, indeed, without knowing what I was about, like an awkward and\\r\\nunlucky lover, I had compromised myself by writing this unfortunate\\r\\nsentence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aha! you are in love with Graeuben?\" he said, with the right look for\\r\\na guardian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; no!\" I stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You love Graeuben,\" he went on once or twice dreamily. \"Well, let us\\r\\napply the process I have suggested to the document in question.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle, falling back into his absorbing contemplations, had already\\r\\nforgotten my imprudent words. I merely say imprudent, for the great\\r\\nmind of so learned a man of course had no place for love affairs, and\\r\\nhappily the grand business of the document gained me the victory.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as the moment of the supreme experiment arrived the Professor\\'s\\r\\neyes flashed right through his spectacles. There was a quivering in\\r\\nhis fingers as he grasped the old parchment. He was deeply moved. At\\r\\nlast he gave a preliminary cough, and with profound gravity, naming\\r\\nin succession the first, then the second letter of each word, he\\r\\ndictated me the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n     mmessvnkaSenrA.icefdoK.segnittamvrtn\\r\\n     ecertserrette,rotaisadva,ednecsedsadne\\r\\n     lacartniiilvIsiratracSarbmvtabiledmek\\r\\n     meretarcsilvcoIsleffenSnI.\\r\\n\\r\\nI confess I felt considerably excited in coming to the end; these\\r\\nletters named, one at a time, had carried no sense to my mind; I\\r\\ntherefore waited for the Professor with great pomp to unfold the\\r\\nmagnificent but hidden Latin of this mysterious phrase.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut who could have foretold the result? A violent thump made the\\r\\nfurniture rattle, and spilt some ink, and my pen dropped from between\\r\\nmy fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s not it,\" cried my uncle, \"there\\'s no sense in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen darting out like a shot, bowling down stairs like an avalanche,\\r\\nhe rushed into the Koenigstrasse and fled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ENEMY TO BE STARVED INTO SUBMISSION\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is gone!\" cried Martha, running out of her kitchen at the noise\\r\\nof the violent slamming of doors.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"completely gone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well; and how about his dinner?\" said the old servant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He won\\'t have any.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And his supper?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He won\\'t have any.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What?\" cried Martha, with clasped hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear Martha, he will eat no more. No one in the house is to\\r\\neat anything at all. Uncle Liedenbrock is going to make us all fast\\r\\nuntil he has succeeded in deciphering an undecipherable scrawl.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my dear! must we then all die of hunger?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI hardly dared to confess that, with so absolute a ruler as my uncle,\\r\\nthis fate was inevitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old servant, visibly moved, returned to the kitchen, moaning\\r\\npiteously.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was alone, I thought I would go and tell Graeuben all about it.\\r\\nBut how should I be able to escape from the house? The Professor\\r\\nmight return at any moment. And suppose he called me? And suppose he\\r\\ntackled me again with this logomachy, which might vainly have been\\r\\nset before ancient Oedipus. And if I did not obey his call, who could\\r\\nanswer for what might happen?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wisest course was to remain where I was. A mineralogist at\\r\\nBesancon had just sent us a collection of siliceous nodules, which I\\r\\nhad to classify: so I set to work; I sorted, labelled, and arranged\\r\\nin their own glass case all these hollow specimens, in the cavity of\\r\\neach of which was a nest of little crystals.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this work did not succeed in absorbing all my attention. That old\\r\\ndocument kept working in my brain. My head throbbed with excitement,\\r\\nand I felt an undefined uneasiness. I was possessed with a\\r\\npresentiment of coming evil.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an hour my nodules were all arranged upon successive shelves. Then\\r\\nI dropped down into the old velvet armchair, my head thrown back and\\r\\nmy hands joined over it. I lighted my long crooked pipe, with a\\r\\npainting on it of an idle-looking naiad; then I amused myself\\r\\nwatching the process of the conversion of the tobacco into carbon,\\r\\nwhich was by slow degrees making my naiad into a negress. Now and\\r\\nthen I listened to hear whether a well-known step was on the stairs.\\r\\nNo. Where could my uncle be at that moment? I fancied him running\\r\\nunder the noble trees which line the road to Altona, gesticulating,\\r\\nmaking shots with his cane, thrashing the long grass, cutting the\\r\\nheads off the thistles, and disturbing the contemplative storks in\\r\\ntheir peaceful solitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould he return in triumph or in discouragement? Which would get the\\r\\nupper hand, he or the secret? I was thus asking myself questions, and\\r\\nmechanically taking between my fingers the sheet of paper\\r\\nmysteriously disfigured with the incomprehensible succession of\\r\\nletters I had written down; and I repeated to myself \"What does it\\r\\nall mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI sought to group the letters so as to form words. Quite impossible!\\r\\nWhen I put them together by twos, threes, fives or sixes, nothing\\r\\ncame of it but nonsense. To be sure the fourteenth, fifteenth and\\r\\nsixteenth letters made the English word \\'ice\\'; the eighty-third and\\r\\ntwo following made \\'sir\\'; and in the midst of the document, in the\\r\\nsecond and third lines, I observed the words, \"rots,\" \"mutabile,\"\\r\\n\"ira,\" \"net,\" \"atra.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come now,\" I thought, \"these words seem to justify my uncle\\'s view\\r\\nabout the language of the document. In the fourth line appeared the\\r\\nword \"luco\", which means a sacred wood. It is true that in the third\\r\\nline was the word \"tabiled\", which looked like Hebrew, and in the\\r\\nlast the purely French words \"mer\", \"arc\", \"mere.\"\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this was enough to drive a poor fellow crazy. Four different\\r\\nlanguages in this ridiculous sentence! What connection could there\\r\\npossibly be between such words as ice, sir, anger, cruel, sacred\\r\\nwood, changeable, mother, bow, and sea? The first and the last might\\r\\nhave something to do with each other; it was not at all surprising\\r\\nthat in a document written in Iceland there should be mention of a\\r\\nsea of ice; but it was quite another thing to get to the end of this\\r\\ncryptogram with so small a clue. So I was struggling with an\\r\\ninsurmountable difficulty; my brain got heated, my eyes watered over\\r\\nthat sheet of paper; its hundred and thirty-two letters seemed to\\r\\nflutter and fly around me like those motes of mingled light and\\r\\ndarkness which float in the air around the head when the blood is\\r\\nrushing upwards with undue violence. I was a prey to a kind of\\r\\nhallucination; I was stifling; I wanted air. Unconsciously I fanned\\r\\nmyself with the bit of paper, the back and front of which\\r\\nsuccessively came before my eyes. What was my surprise when, in one\\r\\nof those rapid revolutions, at the moment when the back was turned to\\r\\nme I thought I caught sight of the Latin words \"craterem,\"\\r\\n\"terrestre,\" and others.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sudden light burst in upon me; these hints alone gave me the first\\r\\nglimpse of the truth; I had discovered the key to the cipher. To read\\r\\nthe document, it would not even be necessary to read it through the\\r\\npaper. Such as it was, just such as it had been dictated to me, so it\\r\\nmight be spelt out with ease. All those ingenious professorial\\r\\ncombinations were coming right. He was right as to the arrangement of\\r\\nthe letters; he was right as to the language. He had been within a\\r\\nhair\\'s breadth of reading this Latin document from end to end; but\\r\\nthat hair\\'s breadth, chance had given it to me!\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may be sure I felt stirred up. My eyes were dim, I could scarcely\\r\\nsee. I had laid the paper upon the table. At a glance I could tell\\r\\nthe whole secret.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last I became more calm. I made a wise resolve to walk twice round\\r\\nthe room quietly and settle my nerves, and then I returned into the\\r\\ndeep gulf of the huge armchair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now I\\'ll read it,\" I cried, after having well distended my lungs\\r\\nwith air.\\r\\n\\r\\nI leaned over the table; I laid my finger successively upon every\\r\\nletter; and without a pause, without one moment\\'s hesitation, I read\\r\\noff the whole sentence aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nStupefaction! terror! I sat overwhelmed as if with a sudden deadly\\r\\nblow. What! that which I read had actually, really been done! A\\r\\nmortal man had had the audacity to penetrate! . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" I cried, springing up. \"But no! no! My uncle shall never know\\r\\nit. He would insist upon doing it too. He would want to know all\\r\\nabout it. Ropes could not hold him, such a determined geologist as he\\r\\nis! He would start, he would, in spite of everything and everybody,\\r\\nand he would take me with him, and we should never get back. No,\\r\\nnever! never!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy over-excitement was beyond all description.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! no! it shall not be,\" I declared energetically; \"and as it is in\\r\\nmy power to prevent the knowledge of it coming into the mind of my\\r\\ntyrant, I will do it. By dint of turning this document round and\\r\\nround, he too might discover the key. I will destroy it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a little fire left on the hearth. I seized not only the\\r\\npaper but Saknussemm\\'s parchment; with a feverish hand I was about to\\r\\nfling it all upon the coals and utterly destroy and abolish this\\r\\ndangerous secret, when the study door opened, and my uncle appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V.\\r\\n\\r\\nFAMINE, THEN VICTORY, FOLLOWED BY DISMAY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI had only just time to replace the unfortunate document upon the\\r\\ntable.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Liedenbrock seemed to be greatly abstracted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ruling thought gave him no rest. Evidently he had gone deeply\\r\\ninto the matter, analytically and with profound scrutiny. He had\\r\\nbrought all the resources of his mind to bear upon it during his\\r\\nwalk, and he had come back to apply some new combination.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat in his armchair, and pen in hand he began what looked very\\r\\nmuch like algebraic formula: I followed with my eyes his trembling\\r\\nhands, I took count of every movement. Might not some unhoped-for\\r\\nresult come of it? I trembled, too, very unnecessarily, since the\\r\\ntrue key was in my hands, and no other would open the secret.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor three long hours my uncle worked on without a word, without\\r\\nlifting his head; rubbing out, beginning again, then rubbing out\\r\\nagain, and so on a hundred times.\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew very well that if he succeeded in setting down these letters\\r\\nin every possible relative position, the sentence would come out. But\\r\\nI knew also that twenty letters alone could form two quintillions,\\r\\nfour hundred and thirty-two quadrillions, nine hundred and two\\r\\ntrillions, eight billions, a hundred and seventy-six millions, six\\r\\nhundred and forty thousand combinations. Now, here were a hundred and\\r\\nthirty-two letters in this sentence, and these hundred and thirty-two\\r\\nletters would give a number of different sentences, each made up of\\r\\nat least a hundred and thirty-three figures, a number which passed\\r\\nfar beyond all calculation or conception.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I felt reassured as far as regarded this heroic method of solving\\r\\nthe difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut time was passing away; night came on; the street noises ceased;\\r\\nmy uncle, bending over his task, noticed nothing, not even Martha\\r\\nhalf opening the door; he heard not a sound, not even that excellent\\r\\nwoman saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will not monsieur take any supper to-night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd poor Martha had to go away unanswered. As for me, after long\\r\\nresistance, I was overcome by sleep, and fell off at the end of the\\r\\nsofa, while uncle Liedenbrock went on calculating and rubbing out his\\r\\ncalculations.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I awoke next morning that indefatigable worker was still at his\\r\\npost. His red eyes, his pale complexion, his hair tangled between his\\r\\nfeverish fingers, the red spots on his cheeks, revealed his desperate\\r\\nstruggle with impossibilities, and the weariness of spirit, the\\r\\nmental wrestlings he must have undergone all through that unhappy\\r\\nnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo tell the plain truth, I pitied him. In spite of the reproaches\\r\\nwhich I considered I had a right to lay upon him, a certain feeling\\r\\nof compassion was beginning to gain upon me. The poor man was so\\r\\nentirely taken up with his one idea that he had even forgotten how to\\r\\nget angry. All the strength of his feelings was concentrated upon one\\r\\npoint alone; and as their usual vent was closed, it was to be feared\\r\\nlest extreme tension should give rise to an explosion sooner or later.\\r\\n\\r\\nI might with a word have loosened the screw of the steel vice that\\r\\nwas crushing his brain; but that word I would not speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet I was not an ill-natured fellow. Why was I dumb at such a crisis?\\r\\nWhy so insensible to my uncle\\'s interests?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" I repeated, \"I shall not speak. He would insist upon going;\\r\\nnothing on earth could stop him. His imagination is a volcano, and to\\r\\ndo that which other geologists have never done he would risk his\\r\\nlife. I will preserve silence. I will keep the secret which mere\\r\\nchance has revealed to me. To discover it, would be to kill Professor\\r\\nLiedenbrock! Let him find it out himself if he can. I will never have\\r\\nit laid to my door that I led him to his destruction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving formed this resolution, I folded my arms and waited. But I had\\r\\nnot reckoned upon one little incident which turned up a few hours\\r\\nafter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen our good Martha wanted to go to Market, she found the door\\r\\nlocked. The big key was gone. Who could have taken it out? Assuredly,\\r\\nit was my uncle, when he returned the night before from his hurried\\r\\nwalk.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas this done on purpose? Or was it a mistake? Did he want to reduce\\r\\nus by famine? This seemed like going rather too far! What! should\\r\\nMartha and I be victims of a position of things in which we had not\\r\\nthe smallest interest? It was a fact that a few years before this,\\r\\nwhilst my uncle was working at his great classification of minerals,\\r\\nhe was forty-eight hours without eating, and all his household were\\r\\nobliged to share in this scientific fast. As for me, what I remember\\r\\nis, that I got severe cramps in my stomach, which hardly suited the\\r\\nconstitution of a hungry, growing lad.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it appeared to me as if breakfast was going to be wanting, just\\r\\nas supper had been the night before. Yet I resolved to be a hero, and\\r\\nnot to be conquered by the pangs of hunger. Martha took it very\\r\\nseriously, and, poor woman, was very much distressed. As for me, the\\r\\nimpossibility of leaving the house distressed me a good deal more,\\r\\nand for a very good reason. A caged lover\\'s feelings may easily be\\r\\nimagined.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle went on working, his imagination went off rambling into the\\r\\nideal world of combinations; he was far away from earth, and really\\r\\nfar away from earthly wants.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout noon hunger began to stimulate me severely. Martha had, without\\r\\nthinking any harm, cleared out the larder the night before, so that\\r\\nnow there was nothing left in the house. Still I held out; I made it\\r\\na point of honour.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo o\\'clock struck. This was becoming ridiculous; worse than that,\\r\\nunbearable. I began to say to myself that I was exaggerating the\\r\\nimportance of the document; that my uncle would surely not believe in\\r\\nit, that he would set it down as a mere puzzle; that if it came to\\r\\nthe worst, we should lay violent hands on him and keep him at home if\\r\\nhe thought on venturing on the expedition; that, after all, he might\\r\\nhimself discover the key of the cipher, and that then I should be\\r\\nclear at the mere expense of my involuntary abstinence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese reasons seemed excellent to me, though on the night before I\\r\\nshould have rejected them with indignation; I even went so far as to\\r\\ncondemn myself for my absurdity in having waited so long, and I\\r\\nfinally resolved to let it all out.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was therefore meditating a proper introduction to the matter, so as\\r\\nnot to seem too abrupt, when the Professor jumped up, clapped on his\\r\\nhat, and prepared to go out.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurely he was not going out, to shut us in again! no, never!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Uncle!\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed not to hear me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Uncle Liedenbrock!\" I cried, lifting up my voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay,\" he answered like a man suddenly waking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Uncle, that key!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What key? The door key?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no!\" I cried. \"The key of the document.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Professor stared at me over his spectacles; no doubt he saw\\r\\nsomething unusual in the expression of my countenance; for he laid\\r\\nhold of my arm, and speechlessly questioned me with his eyes. Yes,\\r\\nnever was a question more forcibly put.\\r\\n\\r\\nI nodded my head up and down.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his pityingly, as if he was dealing with a lunatic. I gave a\\r\\nmore affirmative gesture.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis eyes glistened and sparkled with live fire, his hand was shaken\\r\\nthreateningly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis mute conversation at such a momentous crisis would have riveted\\r\\nthe attention of the most indifferent. And the fact really was that I\\r\\ndared not speak now, so intense was the excitement for fear lest my\\r\\nuncle should smother me in his first joyful embraces. But he became\\r\\nso urgent that I was at last compelled to answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, that key, chance--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is that you are saying?\" he shouted with indescribable emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There, read that!\" I said, presenting a sheet of paper on which I\\r\\nhad written.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But there is nothing in this,\" he answered, crumpling up the paper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, nothing until you proceed to read from the end to the beginning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had not finished my sentence when the Professor broke out into a\\r\\ncry, nay, a roar. A new revelation burst in upon him. He was\\r\\ntransformed!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aha, clever Saknussemm!\" he cried. \"You had first written out your\\r\\nsentence the wrong way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd darting upon the paper, with eyes bedimmed, and voice choked with\\r\\nemotion, he read the whole document from the last letter to the first.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was conceived in the following terms:\\r\\n\\r\\n     In Sneffels Joculis craterem quem delibat\\r\\n     Umbra Scartaris Julii intra calendas descende,\\r\\n     Audax viator, et terrestre centrum attinges.\\r\\n     Quod feci, Arne Saknussemm.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich bad Latin may be translated thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Descend, bold traveller, into the crater of the jokul of Sneffels,\\r\\nwhich the shadow of Scartaris touches before the kalends of July, and\\r\\nyou will attain the centre of the earth; which I have done, Arne\\r\\nSaknussemm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn reading this, my uncle gave a spring as if he had touched a Leyden\\r\\njar. His audacity, his joy, and his convictions were magnificent to\\r\\nbehold. He came and he went; he seized his head between both his\\r\\nhands; he pushed the chairs out of their places, he piled up his\\r\\nbooks; incredible as it may seem, he rattled his precious nodules of\\r\\nflints together; he sent a kick here, a thump there. At last his\\r\\nnerves calmed down, and like a man exhausted by too lavish an\\r\\nexpenditure of vital power, he sank back exhausted into his armchair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What o\\'clock is it?\" he asked after a few moments of silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Three o\\'clock,\" I replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it really? The dinner-hour is past, and I did not know it. I am\\r\\nhalf dead with hunger. Come on, and after dinner--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] In the cipher, _audax_ is written _avdas,_ and _quod_ and _quem,_\\r\\n_hod_ and _ken_. (Tr.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After dinner, pack up my trunk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What?\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yours!\" replied the indefatigable Professor, entering the\\r\\ndining-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXCITING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT AN UNPARALLELED ENTERPRISE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt these words a cold shiver ran through me. Yet I controlled myself;\\r\\nI even resolved to put a good face upon it. Scientific arguments\\r\\nalone could have any weight with Professor Liedenbrock. Now there\\r\\nwere good ones against the practicability of such a journey.\\r\\nPenetrate to the centre of the earth! What nonsense! But I kept my\\r\\ndialectic battery in reserve for a suitable opportunity, and I\\r\\ninterested myself in the prospect of my dinner, which was not yet\\r\\nforthcoming.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is no use to tell of the rage and imprecations of my uncle before\\r\\nthe empty table. Explanations were given, Martha was set at liberty,\\r\\nran off to the market, and did her part so well that in an hour\\r\\nafterwards my hunger was appeased, and I was able to return to the\\r\\ncontemplation of the gravity of the situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring all dinner time my uncle was almost merry; he indulged in some\\r\\nof those learned jokes which never do anybody any harm. Dessert over,\\r\\nhe beckoned me into his study.\\r\\n\\r\\nI obeyed; he sat at one end of his table, I at the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Axel,\" said he very mildly; \"you are a very ingenious young man, you\\r\\nhave done me a splendid service, at a moment when, wearied out with\\r\\nthe struggle, I was going to abandon the contest. Where should I have\\r\\nlost myself? None can tell. Never, my lad, shall I forget it; and you\\r\\nshall have your share in the glory to which your discovery will lead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, come!\" thought I, \"he is in a good way. Now is the time for\\r\\ndiscussing that same glory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Before all things,\" my uncle resumed, \"I enjoin you to preserve the\\r\\nmost inviolable secrecy: you understand? There are not a few in the\\r\\nscientific world who envy my success, and many would be ready to\\r\\nundertake this enterprise, to whom our return should be the first\\r\\nnews of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you really think there are many people bold enough?\" said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly; who would hesitate to acquire such renown? If that\\r\\ndocument were divulged, a whole army of geologists would be ready to\\r\\nrush into the footsteps of Arne Saknussemm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t feel so very sure of that, uncle,\" I replied; \"for we have\\r\\nno proof of the authenticity of this document.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! not of the book, inside which we have discovered it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Granted. I admit that Saknussemm may have written these lines. But\\r\\ndoes it follow that he has really accomplished such a journey? And\\r\\nmay it not be that this old parchment is intended to mislead?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI almost regretted having uttered this last word, which dropped from\\r\\nme in an unguarded moment. The Professor bent his shaggy brows, and I\\r\\nfeared I had seriously compromised my own safety. Happily no great\\r\\nharm came of it. A smile flitted across the lip of my severe\\r\\ncompanion, and he answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is what we shall see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said I, rather put out. \"But do let me exhaust all the possible\\r\\nobjections against this document.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Speak, my boy, don\\'t be afraid. You are quite at liberty to express\\r\\nyour opinions. You are no longer my nephew only, but my colleague.\\r\\nPray go on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, in the first place, I wish to ask what are this Jokul, this\\r\\nSneffels, and this Scartaris, names which I have never heard before?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing easier. I received not long ago a map from my friend,\\r\\nAugustus Petermann, at Liepzig. Nothing could be more apropos. Take\\r\\ndown the third atlas in the second shelf in the large bookcase,\\r\\nseries Z, plate 4.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI rose, and with the help of such precise instructions could not fail\\r\\nto find the required atlas. My uncle opened it and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is one of the best maps of Iceland, that of Handersen, and I\\r\\nbelieve this will solve the worst of our difficulties.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI bent over the map.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see this volcanic island,\" said the Professor; \"observe that all\\r\\nthe volcanoes are called jokuls, a word which means glacier in\\r\\nIcelandic, and under the high latitude of Iceland nearly all the\\r\\nactive volcanoes discharge through beds of ice. Hence this term of\\r\\njokul is applied to all the eruptive mountains in Iceland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good,\" said I; \"but what of Sneffels?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was hoping that this question would be unanswerable; but I was\\r\\nmistaken. My uncle replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Follow my finger along the west coast of Iceland. Do you see\\r\\nRejkiavik, the capital? You do. Well; ascend the innumerable fiords\\r\\nthat indent those sea-beaten shores, and stop at the sixty-fifth\\r\\ndegree of latitude. What do you see there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see a peninsula looking like a thigh bone with the knee bone at\\r\\nthe end of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A very fair comparison, my lad. Now do you see anything upon that\\r\\nknee bone?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; a mountain rising out of the sea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Right. That is Snaefell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That Snaefell?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is. It is a mountain five thousand feet high, one of the most\\r\\nremarkable in the world, if its crater leads down to the centre of\\r\\nthe earth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that is impossible,\" I said shrugging my shoulders, and\\r\\ndisgusted at such a ridiculous supposition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Impossible?\" said the Professor severely; \"and why, pray?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because this crater is evidently filled with lava and burning rocks,\\r\\nand therefore--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But suppose it is an extinct volcano?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Extinct?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; the number of active volcanoes on the surface of the globe is\\r\\nat the present time only about three hundred. But there is a very\\r\\nmuch larger number of extinct ones. Now, Snaefell is one of these.\\r\\nSince historic times there has been but one eruption of this\\r\\nmountain, that of 1219; from that time it has quieted down more and\\r\\nmore, and now it is no longer reckoned among active volcanoes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo such positive statements I could make no reply. I therefore took\\r\\nrefuge in other dark passages of the document.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the meaning of this word Scartaris, and what have the\\r\\nkalends of July to do with it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle took a few minutes to consider. For one short moment I felt\\r\\na ray of hope, speedily to be extinguished. For he soon answered thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is darkness to you is light to me. This proves the ingenious\\r\\ncare with which Saknussemm guarded and defined his discovery.\\r\\nSneffels, or Snaefell, has several craters. It was therefore necessary\\r\\nto point out which of these leads to the centre of the globe. What\\r\\ndid the Icelandic sage do? He observed that at the approach of the\\r\\nkalends of July, that is to say in the last days of June, one of the\\r\\npeaks, called Scartaris, flung its shadow down the mouth of that\\r\\nparticular crater, and he committed that fact to his document. Could\\r\\nthere possibly have been a more exact guide? As soon as we have\\r\\narrived at the summit of Snaefell we shall have no hesitation as to\\r\\nthe proper road to take.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDecidedly, my uncle had answered every one of my objections. I saw\\r\\nthat his position on the old parchment was impregnable. I therefore\\r\\nceased to press him upon that part of the subject, and as above all\\r\\nthings he must be convinced, I passed on to scientific objections,\\r\\nwhich in my opinion were far more serious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then,\" I said, \"I am forced to admit that Saknussemm\\'s\\r\\nsentence is clear, and leaves no room for doubt. I will even allow\\r\\nthat the document bears every mark and evidence of authenticity. That\\r\\nlearned philosopher did get to the bottom of Sneffels, he has seen\\r\\nthe shadow of Scartaris touch the edge of the crater before the\\r\\nkalends of July; he may even have heard the legendary stories told in\\r\\nhis day about that crater reaching to the centre of the world; but as\\r\\nfor reaching it himself, as for performing the journey, and\\r\\nreturning, if he ever went, I say no--he never, never did that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now for your reason?\" said my uncle ironically.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All the theories of science demonstrate such a feat to be\\r\\nimpracticable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The theories say that, do they?\" replied the Professor in the tone\\r\\nof a meek disciple. \"Oh! unpleasant theories! How the theories will\\r\\nhinder us, won\\'t they?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw that he was only laughing at me; but I went on all the same.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; it is perfectly well known that the internal temperature rises\\r\\none degree for every 70 feet in depth; now, admitting this proportion\\r\\nto be constant, and the radius of the earth being fifteen hundred\\r\\nleagues, there must be a temperature of 360,032 degrees at the centre\\r\\nof the earth. Therefore, all the substances that compose the body of\\r\\nthis earth must exist there in a state of incandescent gas; for the\\r\\nmetals that most resist the action of heat, gold, and platinum, and\\r\\nthe hardest rocks, can never be either solid or liquid under such a\\r\\ntemperature. I have therefore good reason for asking if it is\\r\\npossible to penetrate through such a medium.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So, Axel, it is the heat that troubles you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course it is. Were we to reach a depth of thirty miles we should\\r\\nhave arrived at the limit of the terrestrial crust, for there the\\r\\ntemperature will be more than 2372 degrees.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you afraid of being put into a state of fusion?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will leave you to decide that question,\" I answered rather\\r\\nsullenly. \"This is my decision,\" replied Professor Liedenbrock,\\r\\nputting on one of his grandest airs. \"Neither you nor anybody else\\r\\nknows with any certainty what is going on in the interior of this\\r\\nglobe, since not the twelve thousandth part of its radius is known;\\r\\nscience is eminently perfectible; and every new theory is soon routed\\r\\nby a newer. Was it not always believed until Fourier that the\\r\\ntemperature of the interplanetary spaces decreased perpetually? and\\r\\nis it not known at the present time that the greatest cold of the\\r\\nethereal regions is never lower than 40 degrees below zero Fahr.? Why\\r\\nshould it not be the same with the internal heat? Why should it not,\\r\\nat a certain depth, attain an impassable limit, instead of rising to\\r\\nsuch a point as to fuse the most infusible metals?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs my uncle was now taking his stand upon hypotheses, of course,\\r\\nthere was nothing to be said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I will tell you that true savants, amongst them Poisson, have\\r\\ndemonstrated that if a heat of 360,000 degrees [1] existed in the\\r\\ninterior of the globe, the fiery gases arising from the fused matter\\r\\nwould acquire an elastic force which the crust of the earth would be\\r\\nunable to resist, and that it would explode like the plates of a\\r\\nbursting boiler.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is Poisson\\'s opinion, my uncle, nothing more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Granted. But it is likewise the creed adopted by other distinguished\\r\\ngeologists, that the interior of the globe is neither gas nor water,\\r\\nnor any of the heaviest minerals known, for in none of these cases\\r\\nwould the earth weigh what it does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, with figures you may prove anything!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But is it the same with facts! Is it not known that the number of\\r\\nvolcanoes has diminished since the first days of creation? and if\\r\\nthere is central heat may we not thence conclude that it is in\\r\\nprocess of diminution?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My good uncle, if you will enter into the legion of speculation, I\\r\\ncan discuss the matter no longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I have to tell you that the highest names have come to the\\r\\nsupport of my views. Do you remember a visit paid to me by the\\r\\ncelebrated chemist, Humphry Davy, in 1825?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all, for I was not born until nineteen years afterwards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Humphry Davy did call upon me on his way through Hamburg. We\\r\\nwere long engaged in discussing, amongst other problems, the\\r\\nhypothesis of the liquid structure of the terrestrial nucleus. We\\r\\nwere agreed that it could not be in a liquid state, for a reason\\r\\nwhich science has never been able to confute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] The degrees of temperature are given by Jules Verne according to\\r\\nthe centigrade system, for which we will in each case substitute the\\r\\nFahrenheit measurement. (Tr.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is that reason?\" I said, rather astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because this liquid mass would be subject, like the ocean, to the\\r\\nlunar attraction, and therefore twice every day there would be\\r\\ninternal tides, which, upheaving the terrestrial crust, would cause\\r\\nperiodical earthquakes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet it is evident that the surface of the globe has been subject to\\r\\nthe action of fire,\" I replied, \"and it is quite reasonable to\\r\\nsuppose that the external crust cooled down first, whilst the heat\\r\\ntook refuge down to the centre.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite a mistake,\" my uncle answered. \"The earth has been heated by\\r\\ncombustion on its surface, that is all. Its surface was composed of a\\r\\ngreat number of metals, such as potassium and sodium, which have the\\r\\npeculiar property of igniting at the mere contact with air and water;\\r\\nthese metals kindled when the atmospheric vapours fell in rain upon\\r\\nthe soil; and by and by, when the waters penetrated into the fissures\\r\\nof the crust of the earth, they broke out into fresh combustion with\\r\\nexplosions and eruptions. Such was the cause of the numerous\\r\\nvolcanoes at the origin of the earth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, this is a very clever hypothesis,\" I exclaimed, in\\r\\nspite rather of myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And which Humphry Davy demonstrated to me by a simple experiment. He\\r\\nformed a small ball of the metals which I have named, and which was a\\r\\nvery fair representation of our globe; whenever he caused a fine dew\\r\\nof rain to fall upon its surface, it heaved up into little\\r\\nmonticules, it became oxydized and formed miniature mountains; a\\r\\ncrater broke open at one of its summits; the eruption took place, and\\r\\ncommunicated to the whole of the ball such a heat that it could not\\r\\nbe held in the hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn truth, I was beginning to be shaken by the Professor\\'s arguments,\\r\\nbesides which he gave additional weight to them by his usual ardour\\r\\nand fervent enthusiasm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see, Axel,\" he added, \"the condition of the terrestrial nucleus\\r\\nhas given rise to various hypotheses among geologists; there is no\\r\\nproof at all for this internal heat; my opinion is that there is no\\r\\nsuch thing, it cannot be; besides we shall see for ourselves, and,\\r\\nlike Arne Saknussemm, we shall know exactly what to hold as truth\\r\\nconcerning this grand question.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, we shall see,\" I replied, feeling myself carried off by\\r\\nhis contagious enthusiasm. \"Yes, we shall see; that is, if it is\\r\\npossible to see anything there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why not? May we not depend upon electric phenomena to give us\\r\\nlight? May we not even expect light from the atmosphere, the pressure\\r\\nof which may render it luminous as we approach the centre?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes,\" said I; \"that is possible, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is certain,\" exclaimed my uncle in a tone of triumph. \"But\\r\\nsilence, do you hear me? silence upon the whole subject; and let no\\r\\none get before us in this design of discovering the centre of the\\r\\nearth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII.\\r\\n\\r\\nA WOMAN\\'S COURAGE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThus ended this memorable seance. That conversation threw me into a\\r\\nfever. I came out of my uncle\\'s study as if I had been stunned, and\\r\\nas if there was not air enough in all the streets of Hamburg to put\\r\\nme right again. I therefore made for the banks of the Elbe, where the\\r\\nsteamer lands her passengers, which forms the communication between\\r\\nthe city and the Hamburg railway.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas I convinced of the truth of what I had heard? Had I not bent\\r\\nunder the iron rule of the Professor Liedenbrock? Was I to believe\\r\\nhim in earnest in his intention to penetrate to the centre of this\\r\\nmassive globe? Had I been listening to the mad speculations of a\\r\\nlunatic, or to the scientific conclusions of a lofty genius? Where\\r\\ndid truth stop? Where did error begin?\\r\\n\\r\\nI was all adrift amongst a thousand contradictory hypotheses, but I\\r\\ncould not lay hold of one.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet I remembered that I had been convinced, although now my\\r\\nenthusiasm was beginning to cool down; but I felt a desire to start\\r\\nat once, and not to lose time and courage by calm reflection. I had\\r\\nat that moment quite courage enough to strap my knapsack to my\\r\\nshoulders and start.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I must confess that in another hour this unnatural excitement\\r\\nabated, my nerves became unstrung, and from the depths of the abysses\\r\\nof this earth I ascended to its surface again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is quite absurd!\" I cried, \"there is no sense about it. No\\r\\nsensible young man should for a moment entertain such a proposal. The\\r\\nwhole thing is non-existent. I have had a bad night, I have been\\r\\ndreaming of horrors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I had followed the banks of the Elbe and passed the town. After\\r\\npassing the port too, I had reached the Altona road. I was led by a\\r\\npresentiment, soon to be realised; for shortly I espied my little\\r\\nGraeuben bravely returning with her light step to Hamburg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Graeuben!\" I cried from afar off.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young girl stopped, rather frightened perhaps to hear her name\\r\\ncalled after her on the high road. Ten yards more, and I had joined\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Axel!\" she cried surprised. \"What! have you come to meet me? Is this\\r\\nwhy you are here, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when she had looked upon me, Graeuben could not fail to see the\\r\\nuneasiness and distress of my mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter?\" she said, holding out her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter, Graeuben?\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a couple of minutes my pretty Virlandaise was fully informed of\\r\\nthe position of affairs. For a time she was silent. Did her heart\\r\\npalpitate as mine did? I don\\'t know about that, but I know that her\\r\\nhand did not tremble in mine. We went on a hundred yards without\\r\\nspeaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last she said, \"Axel!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Graeuben.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will be a splendid journey!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI gave a bound at these words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Axel, a journey worthy of the nephew of a savant; it is a good\\r\\nthing for a man to be distinguished by some great enterprise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, Graeuben, won\\'t you dissuade me from such an undertaking?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear Axel, and I would willingly go with you, but that a poor\\r\\ngirl would only be in your way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is that quite true?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is true.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! women and young girls, how incomprehensible are your feminine\\r\\nhearts! When you are not the timidest, you are the bravest of\\r\\ncreatures. Reason has nothing to do with your actions. What! did this\\r\\nchild encourage me in such an expedition! Would she not be afraid to\\r\\njoin it herself? And she was driving me to it, one whom she loved!\\r\\n\\r\\nI was disconcerted, and, if I must tell the whole truth, I was\\r\\nashamed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Graeuben, we will see whether you will say the same thing to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To-morrow, dear Axel, I will say what I say to-day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGraeuben and I, hand in hand, but in silence, pursued our way. The\\r\\nemotions of that day were breaking my heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all, I thought, the kalends of July are a long way off, and\\r\\nbetween this and then many things may take place which will cure my\\r\\nuncle of his desire to travel underground.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was night when we arrived at the house in Koenigstrasse. I expected\\r\\nto find all quiet there, my uncle in bed as was his custom, and\\r\\nMartha giving her last touches with the feather brush.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I had not taken into account the Professor\\'s impatience. I found\\r\\nhim shouting--and working himself up amidst a crowd of porters and\\r\\nmessengers who were all depositing various loads in the passage. Our\\r\\nold servant was at her wits\\' end.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Axel, come, you miserable wretch,\" my uncle cried from as far\\r\\noff as he could see me. \"Your boxes are not packed, and my papers are\\r\\nnot arranged; where\\'s the key of my carpet bag? and what have you\\r\\ndone with my gaiters?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI stood thunderstruck. My voice failed. Scarcely could my lips utter\\r\\nthe words:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are we really going?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course, you unhappy boy! Could I have dreamed that you would have\\r\\ngone out for a walk instead of hurrying your preparations forward?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are we to go?\" I asked again, with sinking hopes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; the day after to-morrow, early.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI could hear no more. I fled for refuge into my own little room.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll hope was now at an end. My uncle had been all the morning making\\r\\npurchases of a part of the tools and apparatus required for this\\r\\ndesperate undertaking. The passage was encumbered with rope ladders,\\r\\nknotted cords, torches, flasks, grappling irons, alpenstocks,\\r\\npickaxes, iron shod sticks, enough to load ten men.\\r\\n\\r\\nI spent an awful night. Next morning I was called early. I had quite\\r\\ndecided I would not open the door. But how was I to resist the sweet\\r\\nvoice which was always music to my ears, saying, \"My dear Axel?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI came out of my room. I thought my pale countenance and my red and\\r\\nsleepless eyes would work upon Graeuben\\'s sympathies and change her\\r\\nmind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! my dear Axel,\" she said. \"I see you are better. A night\\'s rest\\r\\nhas done you good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Done me good!\" I exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI rushed to the glass. Well, in fact I did look better than I had\\r\\nexpected. I could hardly believe my own eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Axel,\" she said, \"I have had a long talk with my guardian. He is a\\r\\nbold philosopher, a man of immense courage, and you must remember\\r\\nthat his blood flows in your veins. He has confided to me his plans,\\r\\nhis hopes, and why and how he hopes to attain his object. He will no\\r\\ndoubt succeed. My dear Axel, it is a grand thing to devote yourself\\r\\nto science! What honour will fall upon Herr Liedenbrock, and so be\\r\\nreflected upon his companion! When you return, Axel, you will be a\\r\\nman, his equal, free to speak and to act independently, and free to\\r\\n--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dear girl only finished this sentence by blushing. Her words\\r\\nrevived me. Yet I refused to believe we should start. I drew Graeuben\\r\\ninto the Professor\\'s study.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Uncle, is it true that we are to go?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why do you doubt?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I don\\'t doubt,\" I said, not to vex him; \"but, I ask, what need\\r\\nis there to hurry?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Time, time, flying with irreparable rapidity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is only the 16th May, and until the end of June--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, you monument of ignorance! do you think you can get to Iceland\\r\\nin a couple of days? If you had not deserted me like a fool I should\\r\\nhave taken you to the Copenhagen office, to Liffender & Co., and you\\r\\nwould have learned then that there is only one trip every month from\\r\\nCopenhagen to Rejkiavik, on the 22nd.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, if we waited for the 22nd June we should be too late to see\\r\\nthe shadow of Scartaris touch the crater of Sneffels. Therefore we\\r\\nmust get to Copenhagen as fast as we can to secure our passage. Go\\r\\nand pack up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no reply to this. I went up to my room. Graeuben followed\\r\\nme. She undertook to pack up all things necessary for my voyage. She\\r\\nwas no more moved than if I had been starting for a little trip to\\r\\nLuebeck or Heligoland. Her little hands moved without haste. She\\r\\ntalked quietly. She supplied me with sensible reasons for our\\r\\nexpedition. She delighted me, and yet I was angry with her. Now and\\r\\nthen I felt I ought to break out into a passion, but she took no\\r\\nnotice and went on her way as methodically as ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally the last strap was buckled; I came downstairs. All that day\\r\\nthe philosophical instrument makers and the electricians kept coming\\r\\nand going. Martha was distracted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is master mad?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nI nodded my head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is he going to take you with him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI nodded again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI pointed with my finger downward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Down into the cellar?\" cried the old servant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" I said. \"Lower down than that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNight came. But I knew nothing about the lapse of time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To-morrow morning at six precisely,\" my uncle decreed \"we start.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt ten o\\'clock I fell upon my bed, a dead lump of inert matter. All\\r\\nthrough the night terror had hold of me. I spent it dreaming of\\r\\nabysses. I was a prey to delirium. I felt myself grasped by the\\r\\nProfessor\\'s sinewy hand, dragged along, hurled down, shattered into\\r\\nlittle bits. I dropped down unfathomable precipices with the\\r\\naccelerating velocity of bodies falling through space. My life had\\r\\nbecome an endless fall. I awoke at five with shattered nerves,\\r\\ntrembling and weary. I came downstairs. My uncle was at table,\\r\\ndevouring his breakfast. I stared at him with horror and disgust. But\\r\\ndear Graeuben was there; so I said nothing, and could eat nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt half-past five there was a rattle of wheels outside. A large\\r\\ncarriage was there to take us to the Altona railway station. It was\\r\\nsoon piled up with my uncle\\'s multifarious preparations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where\\'s your box?\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is ready,\" I replied, with faltering voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then make haste down, or we shall lose the train.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now manifestly impossible to maintain the struggle against\\r\\ndestiny. I went up again to my room, and rolling my portmanteaus\\r\\ndownstairs I darted after him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment my uncle was solemnly investing Graeuben with the reins\\r\\nof government. My pretty Virlandaise was as calm and collected as was\\r\\nher wont. She kissed her guardian; but could not restrain a tear in\\r\\ntouching my cheek with her gentle lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Graeuben!\" I murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go, my dear Axel, go! I am now your betrothed; and when you come\\r\\nback I will be your wife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI pressed her in my arms and took my place in the carriage. Martha\\r\\nand the young girl, standing at the door, waved their last farewell.\\r\\nThen the horses, roused by the driver\\'s whistling, darted off at a\\r\\ngallop on the road to Altona.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nSERIOUS PREPARATIONS FOR VERTICAL DESCENT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAltona, which is but a suburb of Hamburg, is the terminus of the Kiel\\r\\nrailway, which was to carry us to the Belts. In twenty minutes we\\r\\nwere in Holstein.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt half-past six the carriage stopped at the station; my uncle\\'s\\r\\nnumerous packages, his voluminous _impedimenta,_ were unloaded,\\r\\nremoved, labelled, weighed, put into the luggage vans, and at seven\\r\\nwe were seated face to face in our compartment. The whistle sounded,\\r\\nthe engine started, we were off.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas I resigned? No, not yet. Yet the cool morning air and the scenes\\r\\non the road, rapidly changed by the swiftness of the train, drew me\\r\\naway somewhat from my sad reflections.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the Professor\\'s reflections, they went far in advance of the\\r\\nswiftest express. We were alone in the carriage, but we sat in\\r\\nsilence. My uncle examined all his pockets and his travelling bag\\r\\nwith the minutest care. I saw that he had not forgotten the smallest\\r\\nmatter of detail.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst other documents, a sheet of paper, carefully folded, bore the\\r\\nheading of the Danish consulate with the signature of W.\\r\\nChristiensen, consul at Hamburg and the Professor\\'s friend. With this\\r\\nwe possessed the proper introductions to the Governor of Iceland.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also observed the famous document most carefully laid up in a\\r\\nsecret pocket in his portfolio. I bestowed a malediction upon it, and\\r\\nthen proceeded to examine the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a very long succession of uninteresting loamy and fertile\\r\\nflats, a very easy country for the construction of railways, and\\r\\npropitious for the laying-down of these direct level lines so dear to\\r\\nrailway companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had no time to get tired of the monotony; for in three hours we\\r\\nstopped at Kiel, close to the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe luggage being labelled for Copenhagen, we had no occasion to look\\r\\nafter it. Yet the Professor watched every article with jealous\\r\\nvigilance, until all were safe on board. There they disappeared in\\r\\nthe hold.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle, notwithstanding his hurry, had so well calculated the\\r\\nrelations between the train and the steamer that we had a whole day\\r\\nto spare. The steamer _Ellenora,_ did not start until night. Thence\\r\\nsprang a feverish state of excitement in which the impatient\\r\\nirascible traveller devoted to perdition the railway directors and\\r\\nthe steamboat companies and the governments which allowed such\\r\\nintolerable slowness. I was obliged to act chorus to him when he\\r\\nattacked the captain of the _Ellenora_ upon this subject. The captain\\r\\ndisposed of us summarily.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Kiel, as elsewhere, we must do something to while away the time.\\r\\nWhat with walking on the verdant shores of the bay within which\\r\\nnestles the little town, exploring the thick woods which make it look\\r\\nlike a nest embowered amongst thick foliage, admiring the villas,\\r\\neach provided with a little bathing house, and moving about and\\r\\ngrumbling, at last ten o\\'clock came.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heavy coils of smoke from the _Ellenora\\'s_ funnel unrolled in the\\r\\nsky, the bridge shook with the quivering of the struggling steam; we\\r\\nwere on board, and owners for the time of two berths, one over the\\r\\nother, in the only saloon cabin on board.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a quarter past the moorings were loosed and the throbbing steamer\\r\\npursued her way over the dark waters of the Great Belt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night was dark; there was a sharp breeze and a rough sea, a few\\r\\nlights appeared on shore through the thick darkness; later on, I\\r\\ncannot tell when, a dazzling light from some lighthouse threw a\\r\\nbright stream of fire along the waves; and this is all I can remember\\r\\nof this first portion of our sail.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt seven in the morning we landed at Korsor, a small town on the west\\r\\ncoast of Zealand. There we were transferred from the boat to another\\r\\nline of railway, which took us by just as flat a country as the plain\\r\\nof Holstein.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree hours\\' travelling brought us to the capital of Denmark. My\\r\\nuncle had not shut his eyes all night. In his impatience I believe he\\r\\nwas trying to accelerate the train with his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last he discerned a stretch of sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Sound!\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt our left was a huge building that looked like a hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s a lunatic asylum,\" said one of or travelling companions.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery good! thought I, just the place we want to end our days in; and\\r\\ngreat as it is, that asylum is not big enough to contain all\\r\\nProfessor Liedenbrock\\'s madness!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt ten in the morning, at last, we set our feet in Copenhagen; the\\r\\nluggage was put upon a carriage and taken with ourselves to the\\r\\nPhoenix Hotel in Breda Gate. This took half an hour, for the station\\r\\nis out of the town. Then my uncle, after a hasty toilet, dragged me\\r\\nafter him. The porter at the hotel could speak German and English;\\r\\nbut the Professor, as a polyglot, questioned him in good Danish, and\\r\\nit was in the same language that that personage directed him to the\\r\\nMuseum of Northern Antiquities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe curator of this curious establishment, in which wonders are\\r\\ngathered together out of which the ancient history of the country\\r\\nmight be reconstructed by means of its stone weapons, its cups and\\r\\nits jewels, was a learned savant, the friend of the Danish consul at\\r\\nHamburg, Professor Thomsen.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle had a cordial letter of introduction to him. As a general\\r\\nrule one savant greets another with coolness. But here the case was\\r\\ndifferent. M. Thomsen, like a good friend, gave the Professor\\r\\nLiedenbrock a cordial greeting, and he even vouchsafed the same\\r\\nkindness to his nephew. It is hardly necessary to say the secret was\\r\\nsacredly kept from the excellent curator; we were simply\\r\\ndisinterested travellers visiting Iceland out of harmless curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Thomsen placed his services at our disposal, and we visited the\\r\\nquays with the object of finding out the next vessel to sail.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was yet in hopes that there would be no means of getting to\\r\\nIceland. But there was no such luck. A small Danish schooner, the\\r\\n_Valkyria_, was to set sail for Rejkiavik on the 2nd of June. The\\r\\ncaptain, M. Bjarne, was on board. His intending passenger was so\\r\\njoyful that he almost squeezed his hands till they ached. That good\\r\\nman was rather surprised at his energy. To him it seemed a very\\r\\nsimple thing to go to Iceland, as that was his business; but to my\\r\\nuncle it was sublime. The worthy captain took advantage of his\\r\\nenthusiasm to charge double fares; but we did not trouble ourselves\\r\\nabout mere trifles. .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must be on board on Tuesday, at seven in the morning,\" said\\r\\nCaptain Bjarne, after having pocketed more dollars than were his due.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen we thanked M. Thomsen for his kindness, \"and we returned to the\\r\\nPhoenix Hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s all right, it\\'s all right,\" my uncle repeated. \"How fortunate\\r\\nwe are to have found this boat ready for sailing. Now let us have\\r\\nsome breakfast and go about the town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went first to Kongens-nye-Torw, an irregular square in which are\\r\\ntwo innocent-looking guns, which need not alarm any one. Close by, at\\r\\nNo. 5, there was a French \"restaurant,\" kept by a cook of the name of\\r\\nVincent, where we had an ample breakfast for four marks each (2_s_.\\r\\n4_d_.).\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I took a childish pleasure in exploring the city; my uncle let\\r\\nme take him with me, but he took notice of nothing, neither the\\r\\ninsignificant king\\'s palace, nor the pretty seventeenth century\\r\\nbridge, which spans the canal before the museum, nor that immense\\r\\ncenotaph of Thorwaldsen\\'s, adorned with horrible mural painting, and\\r\\ncontaining within it a collection of the sculptor\\'s works, nor in a\\r\\nfine park the toylike chateau of Rosenberg, nor the beautiful\\r\\nrenaissance edifice of the Exchange, nor its spire composed of the\\r\\ntwisted tails of four bronze dragons, nor the great windmill on the\\r\\nramparts, whose huge arms dilated in the sea breeze like the sails of\\r\\na ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat delicious walks we should have had together, my pretty\\r\\nVirlandaise and I, along the harbour where the two-deckers and the\\r\\nfrigate slept peaceably by the red roofing of the warehouse, by the\\r\\ngreen banks of the strait, through the deep shades of the trees\\r\\namongst which the fort is half concealed, where the guns are\\r\\nthrusting out their black throats between branches of alder and\\r\\nwillow.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, alas! Graeuben was far away; and I never hoped to see her again.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if my uncle felt no attraction towards these romantic scenes he\\r\\nwas very much struck with the aspect of a certain church spire\\r\\nsituated in the island of Amak, which forms the south-west quarter of\\r\\nCopenhagen.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was ordered to direct my feet that way; I embarked on a small\\r\\nsteamer which plies on the canals, and in a few minutes she touched\\r\\nthe quay of the dockyard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter crossing a few narrow streets where some convicts, in trousers\\r\\nhalf yellow and half grey, were at work under the orders of the\\r\\ngangers, we arrived at the Vor Frelsers Kirk. There was nothing\\r\\nremarkable about the church; but there was a reason why its tall\\r\\nspire had attracted the Professor\\'s attention. Starting from the top\\r\\nof the tower, an external staircase wound around the spire, the\\r\\nspirals circling up into the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us get to the top,\" said my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall be dizzy,\" I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The more reason why we should go up; we must get used to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, I tell you; don\\'t waste our time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had to obey. A keeper who lived at the other end of the street\\r\\nhanded us the key, and the ascent began.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle went ahead with a light step. I followed him not without\\r\\nalarm, for my head was very apt to feel dizzy; I possessed neither\\r\\nthe equilibrium of an eagle nor his fearless nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs long as we were protected on the inside of the winding staircase\\r\\nup the tower, all was well enough; but after toiling up a hundred and\\r\\nfifty steps the fresh air came to salute my face, and we were on the\\r\\nleads of the tower. There the aerial staircase began its gyrations,\\r\\nonly guarded by a thin iron rail, and the narrowing steps seemed to\\r\\nascend into infinite space!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never shall I be able to do it,\" I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be a coward; come up, sir\"; said my uncle with the coldest\\r\\ncruelty.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had to follow, clutching at every step. The keen air made me giddy;\\r\\nI felt the spire rocking with every gust of wind; my knees began to\\r\\nfail; soon I was crawling on my knees, then creeping on my stomach; I\\r\\nclosed my eyes; I seemed to be lost in space.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last I reached the apex, with the assistance of my uncle dragging\\r\\nme up by the collar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look down!\" he cried. \"Look down well! You must take a lesson\\r\\nin abysses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI opened my eyes. I saw houses squashed flat as if they had all\\r\\nfallen down from the skies; a smoke fog seemed to drown them. Over my\\r\\nhead ragged clouds were drifting past, and by an optical inversion\\r\\nthey seemed stationary, while the steeple, the ball and I were all\\r\\nspinning along with fantastic speed. Far away on one side was the\\r\\ngreen country, on the other the sea sparkled, bathed in sunlight. The\\r\\nSound stretched away to Elsinore, dotted with a few white sails, like\\r\\nsea-gulls\\' wings; and in the misty east and away to the north-east\\r\\nlay outstretched the faintly-shadowed shores of Sweden. All this\\r\\nimmensity of space whirled and wavered, fluctuating beneath my eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I was compelled to rise, to stand up, to look. My first lesson in\\r\\ndizziness lasted an hour. When I got permission to come down and feel\\r\\nthe solid street pavements I was afflicted with severe lumbago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To-morrow we will do it again,\" said the Professor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it was so; for five days in succession, I was obliged to undergo\\r\\nthis anti-vertiginous exercise; and whether I would or not, I made\\r\\nsome improvement in the art of \"lofty contemplations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX.\\r\\n\\r\\nICELAND! BUT WHAT NEXT?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day for our departure arrived. The day before it our kind friend\\r\\nM. Thomsen brought us letters of introduction to Count Trampe, the\\r\\nGovernor of Iceland, M. Picturssen, the bishop\\'s suffragan, and M.\\r\\nFinsen, mayor of Rejkiavik. My uncle expressed his gratitude by\\r\\ntremendous compressions of both his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 2nd, at six in the evening, all our precious baggage being\\r\\nsafely on board the _Valkyria,_ the captain took us into a very\\r\\nnarrow cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is the wind favourable?\" my uncle asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excellent,\" replied Captain Bjarne; \"a sou\\'-easter. We shall pass\\r\\ndown the Sound full speed, with all sails set.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few minutes the schooner, under her mizen, brigantine, topsail,\\r\\nand topgallant sail, loosed from her moorings and made full sail\\r\\nthrough the straits. In an hour the capital of Denmark seemed to sink\\r\\nbelow the distant waves, and the _Valkyria_ was skirting the coast by\\r\\nElsinore. In my nervous frame of mind I expected to see the ghost of\\r\\nHamlet wandering on the legendary castle terrace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sublime madman!\" I said, \"no doubt you would approve of our\\r\\nexpedition. Perhaps you would keep us company to the centre of the\\r\\nglobe, to find the solution of your eternal doubts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was no ghostly shape upon the ancient walls. Indeed, the\\r\\ncastle is much younger than the heroic prince of Denmark. It now\\r\\nanswers the purpose of a sumptuous lodge for the doorkeeper of the\\r\\nstraits of the Sound, before which every year there pass fifteen\\r\\nthousand ships of all nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe castle of Kronsberg soon disappeared in the mist, as well as the\\r\\ntower of Helsingborg, built on the Swedish coast, and the schooner\\r\\npassed lightly on her way urged by the breezes of the Cattegat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _Valkyria_ was a splendid sailer, but on a sailing vessel you can\\r\\nplace no dependence. She was taking to Rejkiavik coal, household\\r\\ngoods, earthenware, woollen clothing, and a cargo of wheat. The crew\\r\\nconsisted of five men, all Danes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How long will the passage take?\" my uncle asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ten days,\" the captain replied, \"if we don\\'t meet a nor\\'-wester in\\r\\npassing the Faroes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But are you not subject to considerable delays?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, M. Liedenbrock, don\\'t be uneasy, we shall get there in very good\\r\\ntime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt evening the schooner doubled the Skaw at the northern point of\\r\\nDenmark, in the night passed the Skager Rack, skirted Norway by Cape\\r\\nLindness, and entered the North Sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn two days more we sighted the coast of Scotland near Peterhead, and\\r\\nthe _Valkyria_ turned her lead towards the Faroe Islands, passing\\r\\nbetween the Orkneys and Shetlands.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon the schooner encountered the great Atlantic swell; she had to\\r\\ntack against the north wind, and reached the Faroes only with some\\r\\ndifficulty. On the 8th the captain made out Myganness, the\\r\\nsouthernmost of these islands, and from that moment took a straight\\r\\ncourse for Cape Portland, the most southerly point of Iceland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe passage was marked by nothing unusual. I bore the troubles of the\\r\\nsea pretty well; my uncle, to his own intense disgust, and his\\r\\ngreater shame, was ill all through the voyage.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe therefore was unable to converse with the captain about Snaefell,\\r\\nthe way to get to it, the facilities for transport, he was obliged to\\r\\nput off these inquiries until his arrival, and spent all his time at\\r\\nfull length in his cabin, of which the timbers creaked and shook with\\r\\nevery pitch she took. It must be confessed he was not undeserving of\\r\\nhis punishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 11th we reached Cape Portland. The clear open weather gave us\\r\\na good view of Myrdals jokul, which overhangs it. The cape is merely\\r\\na low hill with steep sides, standing lonely by the beach.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _Valkyria_ kept at some distance from the coast, taking a\\r\\nwesterly course amidst great shoals of whales and sharks. Soon we\\r\\ncame in sight of an enormous perforated rock, through which the sea\\r\\ndashed furiously. The Westman islets seemed to rise out of the ocean\\r\\nlike a group of rocks in a liquid plain. From that time the schooner\\r\\ntook a wide berth and swept at a great distance round Cape\\r\\nRejkianess, which forms the western point of Iceland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rough sea prevented my uncle from coming on deck to admire these\\r\\nshattered and surf-beaten coasts.\\r\\n\\r\\nForty-eight hours after, coming out of a storm which forced the\\r\\nschooner to scud under bare poles, we sighted east of us the beacon\\r\\non Cape Skagen, where dangerous rocks extend far away seaward. An\\r\\nIcelandic pilot came on board, and in three hours the _Valkyria_\\r\\ndropped her anchor before Rejkiavik, in Faxa Bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Professor at last emerged from his cabin, rather pale and\\r\\nwretched-looking, but still full of enthusiasm, and with ardent\\r\\nsatisfaction shining in his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe population of the town, wonderfully interested in the arrival of\\r\\na vessel from which every one expected something, formed in groups\\r\\nupon the quay.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle left in haste his floating prison, or rather hospital. But\\r\\nbefore quitting the deck of the schooner he dragged me forward, and\\r\\npointing with outstretched finger north of the bay at a distant\\r\\nmountain terminating in a double peak, a pair of cones covered with\\r\\nperpetual snow, he cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Snaefell! Snaefell!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen recommending me, by an impressive gesture, to keep silence, he\\r\\nwent into the boat which awaited him. I followed, and presently we\\r\\nwere treading the soil of Iceland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first man we saw was a good-looking fellow enough, in a general\\'s\\r\\nuniform. Yet he was not a general but a magistrate, the Governor of\\r\\nthe island, M. le Baron Trampe himself. The Professor was soon aware\\r\\nof the presence he was in. He delivered him his letters from\\r\\nCopenhagen, and then followed a short conversation in the Danish\\r\\nlanguage, the purport of which I was quite ignorant of, and for a\\r\\nvery good reason. But the result of this first conversation was, that\\r\\nBaron Trampe placed himself entirely at the service of Professor\\r\\nLiedenbrock.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle was just as courteously received by the mayor, M. Finsen,\\r\\nwhose appearance was as military, and disposition and office as\\r\\npacific, as the Governor\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the bishop\\'s suffragan, M. Picturssen, he was at that moment\\r\\nengaged on an episcopal visitation in the north. For the time we must\\r\\nbe resigned to wait for the honour of being presented to him. But M.\\r\\nFridrikssen, professor of natural sciences at the school of\\r\\nRejkiavik, was a delightful man, and his friendship became very\\r\\nprecious to me. This modest philosopher spoke only Danish and Latin.\\r\\nHe came to proffer me his good offices in the language of Horace, and\\r\\nI felt that we were made to understand each other. In fact he was the\\r\\nonly person in Iceland with whom I could converse at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis good-natured gentleman made over to us two of the three rooms\\r\\nwhich his house contained, and we were soon installed in it with all\\r\\nour luggage, the abundance of which rather astonished the good people\\r\\nof Rejkiavik.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Axel,\" said my uncle, \"we are getting on, and now the worst is\\r\\nover.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The worst!\" I said, astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure, now we have nothing to do but go down.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, if that is all, you are quite right; but after all, when we have\\r\\ngone down, we shall have to get up again, I suppose?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh I don\\'t trouble myself about that. Come, there\\'s no time to lose;\\r\\nI am going to the library. Perhaps there is some manuscript of\\r\\nSaknussemm\\'s there, and I should be glad to consult it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, while you are there I will go into the town. Won\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that is very uninteresting to me. It is not what is upon this\\r\\nisland, but what is underneath, that interests me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI went out, and wandered wherever chance took me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would not be easy to lose your way in Rejkiavik. I was therefore\\r\\nunder no necessity to inquire the road, which exposes one to mistakes\\r\\nwhen the only medium of intercourse is gesture.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe town extends along a low and marshy level, between two hills. An\\r\\nimmense bed of lava bounds it on one side, and falls gently towards\\r\\nthe sea. On the other extends the vast bay of Faxa, shut in at the\\r\\nnorth by the enormous glacier of the Snaefell, and of which the\\r\\n_Valkyria_ was for the time the only occupant. Usually the English\\r\\nand French conservators of fisheries moor in this bay, but just then\\r\\nthey were cruising about the western coasts of the island.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe longest of the only two streets that Rejkiavik possesses was\\r\\nparallel with the beach. Here live the merchants and traders, in\\r\\nwooden cabins made of red planks set horizontally; the other street,\\r\\nrunning west, ends at the little lake between the house of the bishop\\r\\nand other non-commercial people.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had soon explored these melancholy ways; here and there I got a\\r\\nglimpse of faded turf, looking like a worn-out bit of carpet, or some\\r\\nappearance of a kitchen garden, the sparse vegetables of which\\r\\n(potatoes, cabbages, and lettuces), would have figured appropriately\\r\\nupon a Lilliputian table. A few sickly wallflowers were trying to\\r\\nenjoy the air and sunshine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the middle of the tin-commercial street I found the public\\r\\ncemetery, inclosed with a mud wall, and where there seemed plenty of\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a few steps brought me to the Governor\\'s house, a but compared\\r\\nwith the town hall of Hamburg, a palace in comparison with the cabins\\r\\nof the Icelandic population.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the little lake and the town the church is built in the\\r\\nProtestant style, of calcined stones extracted out of the volcanoes\\r\\nby their own labour and at their own expense; in high westerly winds\\r\\nit was manifest that the red tiles of the roof would be scattered in\\r\\nthe air, to the great danger of the faithful worshippers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a neighbouring hill I perceived the national school, where, as I\\r\\nwas informed later by our host, were taught Hebrew, English, French,\\r\\nand Danish, four languages of which, with shame I confess it, I don\\'t\\r\\nknow a single word; after an examination I should have had to stand\\r\\nlast of the forty scholars educated at this little college, and I\\r\\nshould have been held unworthy to sleep along with them in one of\\r\\nthose little double closets, where more delicate youths would have\\r\\ndied of suffocation the very first night.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn three hours I had seen not only the town but its environs. The\\r\\ngeneral aspect was wonderfully dull. No trees, and scarcely any\\r\\nvegetation. Everywhere bare rocks, signs of volcanic action. The\\r\\nIcelandic huts are made of earth and turf, and the walls slope\\r\\ninward; they rather resemble roofs placed on the ground. But then\\r\\nthese roofs are meadows of comparative fertility. Thanks to the\\r\\ninternal heat, the grass grows on them to some degree of perfection.\\r\\nIt is carefully mown in the hay season; if it were not, the horses\\r\\nwould come to pasture on these green abodes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my excursion I met but few people. On returning to the main street\\r\\nI found the greater part of the population busied in drying, salting,\\r\\nand putting on board codfish, their chief export. The men looked like\\r\\nrobust but heavy, blond Germans with pensive eyes, conscious of being\\r\\nfar removed from their fellow creatures, poor exiles relegated to\\r\\nthis land of ice, poor creatures who should have been Esquimaux,\\r\\nsince nature had condemned them to live only just outside the arctic\\r\\ncircle! In vain did I try to detect a smile upon their lips;\\r\\nsometimes by a spasmodic and involuntary contraction of the muscles\\r\\nthey seemed to laugh, but they never smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir costume consisted of a coarse jacket of black woollen cloth\\r\\ncalled in Scandinavian lands a \\'vadmel,\\' a hat with a very broad\\r\\nbrim, trousers with a narrow edge of red, and a bit of leather rolled\\r\\nround the foot for shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe women looked as sad and as resigned as the men; their faces were\\r\\nagreeable but expressionless, and they wore gowns and petticoats of\\r\\ndark \\'vadmel\\'; as maidens, they wore over their braided hair a little\\r\\nknitted brown cap; when married, they put around their heads a\\r\\ncoloured handkerchief, crowned with a peak of white linen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a good walk I returned to M. Fridrikssen\\'s house, where I found\\r\\nmy uncle already in his host\\'s company.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X.\\r\\n\\r\\nINTERESTING CONVERSATIONS WITH ICELANDIC SAVANTS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDinner was ready. Professor Liedenbrock devoured his portion\\r\\nvoraciously, for his compulsory fast on board had converted his\\r\\nstomach into a vast unfathomable gulf. There was nothing remarkable\\r\\nin the meal itself; but the hospitality of our host, more Danish than\\r\\nIcelandic, reminded me of the heroes of old. It was evident that we\\r\\nwere more at home than he was himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation was carried on in the vernacular tongue, which my\\r\\nuncle mixed with German and M. Fridrikssen with Latin for my benefit.\\r\\nIt turned upon scientific questions as befits philosophers; but\\r\\nProfessor Liedenbrock was excessively reserved, and at every sentence\\r\\nspoke to me with his eyes, enjoining the most absolute silence upon\\r\\nour plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place M. Fridrikssen wanted to know what success my\\r\\nuncle had had at the library.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your library! why there is nothing but a few tattered books upon\\r\\nalmost deserted shelves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\" replied M. Fridrikssen, \"why we possess eight thousand\\r\\nvolumes, many of them valuable and scarce, works in the old\\r\\nScandinavian language, and we have all the novelties that Copenhagen\\r\\nsends us every year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where do you keep your eight thousand volumes? For my part--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, M. Liedenbrock, they are all over the country. In this icy\\r\\nregion we are fond of study. There is not a farmer nor a fisherman\\r\\nthat cannot read and does not read. Our principle is, that books,\\r\\ninstead of growing mouldy behind an iron grating, should be worn out\\r\\nunder the eyes of many readers. Therefore, these volumes are passed\\r\\nfrom one to another, read over and over, referred to again and again;\\r\\nand it often happens that they find their way back to their shelves\\r\\nonly after an absence of a year or two.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And in the meantime,\" said my uncle rather spitefully, \"strangers--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what would you have? Foreigners have their libraries at home,\\r\\nand the first essential for labouring people is that they should be\\r\\neducated. I repeat to you the love of reading runs in Icelandic\\r\\nblood. In 1816 we founded a prosperous literary society; learned\\r\\nstrangers think themselves honoured in becoming members of it. It\\r\\npublishes books which educate our fellow-countrymen, and do the\\r\\ncountry great service. If you will consent to be a corresponding\\r\\nmember, Herr Liedenbrock, you will be giving us great pleasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle, who had already joined about a hundred learned societies,\\r\\naccepted with a grace which evidently touched M. Fridrikssen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said he, \"will you be kind enough to tell me what books you\\r\\nhoped to find in our library and I may perhaps enable you to consult\\r\\nthem?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle\\'s eyes and mine met. He hesitated. This direct question went\\r\\nto the root of the matter. But after a moment\\'s reflection he decided\\r\\non speaking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Monsieur Fridrikssen, I wished to know if amongst your ancient books\\r\\nyou possessed any of the works of Arne Saknussemm?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Arne Saknussemm!\" replied the Rejkiavik professor. \"You mean that\\r\\nlearned sixteenth century savant, a naturalist, a chemist, and a\\r\\ntraveller?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just so!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One of the glories of Icelandic literature and science?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An illustrious man anywhere!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And whose courage was equal to his genius!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see that you know him well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle was bathed in delight at hearing his hero thus described. He\\r\\nfeasted his eyes upon M. Fridrikssen\\'s face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" he cried, \"where are his works?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His works, we have them not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What--not in Iceland?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are neither in Iceland nor anywhere else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why is that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because Arne Saknussemm was persecuted for heresy, and in 1573 his\\r\\nbooks were burned by the hands of the common hangman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good! Excellent!\" cried my uncle, to the great scandal of the\\r\\nprofessor of natural history.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What!\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes; now it is all clear, now it is all unravelled; and I see\\r\\nwhy Saknussemm, put into the Index Expurgatorius, and compelled to\\r\\nhide the discoveries made by his genius, was obliged to bury in an\\r\\nincomprehensible cryptogram the secret--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What secret?\" asked M. Fridrikssen, starting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, just a secret which--\" my uncle stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you some private document in your possession?\" asked our host.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; I was only supposing a case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, very well,\" answered M. Fridrikssen, who was kind enough not to\\r\\npursue the subject when he had noticed the embarrassment of his\\r\\nfriend. \"I hope you will not leave our island until you have seen\\r\\nsome of its mineralogical wealth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" replied my uncle; \"but I am rather late; or have not\\r\\nothers been here before me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Herr Liedenbrock; the labours of MM. Olafsen and Povelsen,\\r\\npursued by order of the king, the researches of Troil the scientific\\r\\nmission of MM. Gaimard and Robert on the French corvette _La\\r\\nRecherche,_ [1] and lately the observations of scientific men who\\r\\ncame in the _Reine Hortense,_ have added materially to our knowledge\\r\\nof Iceland. But I assure you there is plenty left.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think so?\" said my uncle, pretending to look very modest, and\\r\\ntrying to hide the curiosity was flashing out of his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes; how many mountains, glaciers, and volcanoes there are to\\r\\nstudy, which are as yet but imperfectly known! Then, without going\\r\\nany further, that mountain in the horizon. That is Snaefell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said my uncle, as coolly as he was able, \"is that Snaefell?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; one of the most curious volcanoes, and the crater of which has\\r\\nscarcely ever been visited.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it extinct?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes; more than five hundred years.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" replied my uncle, who was frantically locking his legs together\\r\\nto keep himself from jumping up in the air, \"that is where I mean to\\r\\nbegin my geological studies, there on that Seffel--Fessel--what do you\\r\\ncall it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Snaefell,\" replied the excellent M. Fridrikssen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis part of the conversation was in Latin; I had understood every\\r\\nword of it, and I could hardly conceal my amusement at seeing my\\r\\nuncle trying to keep down the excitement and satisfaction which were\\r\\nbrimming over in every limb and every feature. He tried hard to put\\r\\non an innocent little expression of simplicity; but it looked like a\\r\\ndiabolical grin.\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] _Recherche_ was sent out in 1835 by Admiral Duperre to learn the\\r\\nfate of the lost expedition of M. de Blosseville in the _Lilloise_\\r\\nwhich has never been heard of.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"your words decide me. We will try to scale that\\r\\nSnaefell; perhaps even we may pursue our studies in its crater!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very sorry,\" said M. Fridrikssen, \"that my engagements will not\\r\\nallow me to absent myself, or I would have accompanied you myself\\r\\nwith both pleasure and profit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, no!\" replied my uncle with great animation, \"we would not\\r\\ndisturb any one for the world, M. Fridrikssen. Still, I thank you\\r\\nwith all my heart: the company of such a talented man would have been\\r\\nvery serviceable, but the duties of your profession--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI am glad to think that our host, in the innocence of his Icelandic\\r\\nsoul, was blind to the transparent artifices of my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I very much approve of your beginning with that volcano, M.\\r\\nLiedenbrock. You will gather a harvest of interesting observations.\\r\\nBut, tell me, how do you expect to get to the peninsula of Snaefell?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By sea, crossing the bay. That\\'s the most direct way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No doubt; but it is impossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because we don\\'t possess a single boat at Rejkiavik.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t mean to say so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will have to go by land, following the shore. It will be longer,\\r\\nbut more interesting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, then; and now I shall have to see about a guide.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have one to offer you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A safe, intelligent man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; an inhabitant of that peninsula. He is an eider-down hunter, and\\r\\nvery clever. He speaks Danish perfectly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When can I see him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To-morrow, if you like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because he won\\'t be here till to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To-morrow, then,\" added my uncle with a sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis momentous conversation ended in a few minutes with warm\\r\\nacknowledgments paid by the German to the Icelandic Professor. At\\r\\nthis dinner my uncle had just elicited important facts, amongst\\r\\nothers, the history of Saknussemm, the reason of the mysterious\\r\\ndocument, that his host would not accompany him in his expedition,\\r\\nand that the very next day a guide would be waiting upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI.\\r\\n\\r\\nA GUIDE FOUND TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening I took a short walk on the beach and returned at night\\r\\nto my plank-bed, where I slept soundly all night.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I awoke I heard my uncle talking at a great rate in the next\\r\\nroom. I immediately dressed and joined him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was conversing in the Danish language with a tall man, of robust\\r\\nbuild. This fine fellow must have been possessed of great strength.\\r\\nHis eyes, set in a large and ingenuous face, seemed to me very\\r\\nintelligent; they were of a dreamy sea-blue. Long hair, which would\\r\\nhave been called red even in England, fell in long meshes upon his\\r\\nbroad shoulders. The movements of this native were lithe and supple;\\r\\nbut he made little use of his arms in speaking, like a man who knew\\r\\nnothing or cared nothing about the language of gestures. His whole\\r\\nappearance bespoke perfect calmness and self-possession, not\\r\\nindolence but tranquillity. It was felt at once that he would be\\r\\nbeholden to nobody, that he worked for his own convenience, and that\\r\\nnothing in this world could astonish or disturb his philosophic\\r\\ncalmness.\\r\\n\\r\\nI caught the shades of this Icelander\\'s character by the way in which\\r\\nhe listened to the impassioned flow of words which fell from the\\r\\nProfessor. He stood with arms crossed, perfectly unmoved by my\\r\\nuncle\\'s incessant gesticulations. A negative was expressed by a slow\\r\\nmovement of the head from left to right, an affirmative by a slight\\r\\nbend, so slight that his long hair scarcely moved. He carried economy\\r\\nof motion even to parsimony.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly I should never have dreamt in looking at this man that he\\r\\nwas a hunter; he did not look likely to frighten his game, nor did he\\r\\nseem as if he would even get near it. But the mystery was explained\\r\\nwhen M. Fridrikssen informed me that this tranquil personage was only\\r\\na hunter of the eider duck, whose under plumage constitutes the chief\\r\\nwealth of the island. This is the celebrated eider down, and it\\r\\nrequires no great rapidity of movement to get it.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in summer the female, a very pretty bird, goes to build her\\r\\nnest among the rocks of the fiords with which the coast is fringed.\\r\\nAfter building the nest she feathers it with down plucked from her\\r\\nown breast. Immediately the hunter, or rather the trader, comes and\\r\\nrobs the nest, and the female recommences her work. This goes on as\\r\\nlong as she has any down left. When she has stripped herself bare the\\r\\nmale takes his turn to pluck himself. But as the coarse and hard\\r\\nplumage of the male has no commercial value, the hunter does not take\\r\\nthe trouble to rob the nest of this; the female therefore lays her\\r\\neggs in the spoils of her mate, the young are hatched, and next year\\r\\nthe harvest begins again.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as the eider duck does not select steep cliffs for her nest, but\\r\\nrather the smooth terraced rocks which slope to the sea, the\\r\\nIcelandic hunter might exercise his calling without any inconvenient\\r\\nexertion. He was a farmer who was not obliged either to sow or reap\\r\\nhis harvest, but merely to gather it in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis grave, phlegmatic, and silent individual was called Hans Bjelke;\\r\\nand he came recommended by M. Fridrikssen. He was our future guide.\\r\\nHis manners were a singular contrast with my uncle\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, they soon came to understand each other. Neither looked\\r\\nat the amount of the payment: the one was ready to accept whatever\\r\\nwas offered; the other was ready to give whatever was demanded. Never\\r\\nwas bargain more readily concluded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result of the treaty was, that Hans engaged on his part to\\r\\nconduct us to the village of Stapi, on the south shore of the Snaefell\\r\\npeninsula, at the very foot of the volcano. By land this would be\\r\\nabout twenty-two miles, to be done, said my uncle, in two days.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when he learnt that the Danish mile was 24,000 feet long, he was\\r\\nobliged to modify his calculations and allow seven or eight days for\\r\\nthe march.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour horses were to be placed at our disposal--two to carry him and\\r\\nme, two for the baggage. Hams, as was his custom, would go on foot.\\r\\nHe knew all that part of the coast perfectly, and promised to take us\\r\\nthe shortest way.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis engagement was not to terminate with our arrival at Stapi; he was\\r\\nto continue in my uncle\\'s service for the whole period of his\\r\\nscientific researches, for the remuneration of three rixdales a week\\r\\n(about twelve shillings), but it was an express article of the\\r\\ncovenant that his wages should be counted out to him every Saturday\\r\\nat six o\\'clock in the evening, which, according to him, was one\\r\\nindispensable part of the engagement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe start was fixed for the 16th of June. My uncle wanted to pay the\\r\\nhunter a portion in advance, but he refused with one word:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Efter,_\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After,\" said the Professor for my edification.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe treaty concluded, Hans silently withdrew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A famous fellow,\" cried my uncle; \"but he little thinks of the\\r\\nmarvellous part he has to play in the future.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So he is to go with us as far as--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As far as the centre of the earth, Axel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nForty-eight hours were left before our departure; to my great regret\\r\\nI had to employ them in preparations; for all our ingenuity was\\r\\nrequired to pack every article to the best advantage; instruments\\r\\nhere, arms there, tools in this package, provisions in that: four\\r\\nsets of packages in all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe instruments were:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. An Eigel\\'s centigrade thermometer, graduated up to 150 degrees\\r\\n(302 degrees Fahr.), which seemed to me too much or too little. Too\\r\\nmuch if the internal heat was to rise so high, for in this case we\\r\\nshould be baked, not enough to measure the temperature of springs or\\r\\nany matter in a state of fusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. An aneroid barometer, to indicate extreme pressures of the\\r\\natmosphere. An ordinary barometer would not have answered the\\r\\npurpose, as the pressure would increase during our descent to a point\\r\\nwhich the mercurial barometer [1] would not register.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. A chronometer, made by Boissonnas, jun., of Geneva, accurately set\\r\\nto the meridian of Hamburg.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Two compasses, viz., a common compass and a dipping needle.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. A night glass.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Two of Ruhmkorff\\'s apparatus, which, by means of an electric\\r\\ncurrent, supplied a safe and handy portable light [2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arms consisted of two of Purdy\\'s rifles and two brace of pistols.\\r\\nBut what did we want arms for? We had neither savages nor wild beasts\\r\\nto fear, I supposed. But my uncle seemed to believe in his arsenal as\\r\\nin his instruments, and more especially in a considerable quantity of\\r\\ngun cotton, which is unaffected by moisture, and the explosive force\\r\\nof which exceeds that of gunpowder.\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] In M. Verne\\'s book a \\'manometer\\' is the instrument used, of which\\r\\nvery little is known. In a complete list of philosophical instruments\\r\\nthe translator cannot find the name. As he is assured by a first-rate\\r\\ninstrument maker, Chadburn, of Liverpool, that an aneroid can be\\r\\nconstructed to measure any depth, he has thought it best to furnish\\r\\nthe adventurous professor with this more familiar instrument. The\\r\\n\\'manometer\\' is generally known as a pressure gauge.--TRANS.\\r\\n\\r\\n[2] Ruhmkorff\\'s apparatus consists of a Bunsen pile worked with\\r\\nbichromate of potash, which makes no smell; an induction coil carries\\r\\nthe electricity generated by the pile into communication with a\\r\\nlantern of peculiar construction; in this lantern there is a spiral\\r\\nglass tube from which the air has been excluded, and in which remains\\r\\nonly a residuum of carbonic acid gas or of nitrogen. When the\\r\\napparatus is put in action this gas becomes luminous, producing a\\r\\nwhite steady light. The pile and coil are placed in a leathern bag\\r\\nwhich the traveller carries over his shoulders; the lantern outside\\r\\nof the bag throws sufficient light into deep darkness; it enables one\\r\\nto venture without fear of explosions into the midst of the most\\r\\ninflammable gases, and is not extinguished even in the deepest\\r\\nwaters. M. Ruhmkorff is a learned and most ingenious man of science;\\r\\nhis great discovery is his induction coil, which produces a powerful\\r\\nstream of electricity. He obtained in 1864 the quinquennial prize of\\r\\n50,000 franc reserved by the French government for the most ingenious\\r\\napplication of electricity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tools comprised two pickaxes, two spades, a silk ropeladder,\\r\\nthree iron-tipped sticks, a hatchet, a hammer, a dozen wedges and\\r\\niron spikes, and a long knotted rope. Now this was a large load, for\\r\\nthe ladder was 300 feet long.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there were provisions too: this was not a large parcel, but it\\r\\nwas comforting to know that of essence of beef and biscuits there\\r\\nwere six months\\' consumption. Spirits were the only liquid, and of\\r\\nwater we took none; but we had flasks, and my uncle depended on\\r\\nsprings from which to fill them. Whatever objections I hazarded as to\\r\\ntheir quality, temperature, and even absence, remained ineffectual.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo complete the exact inventory of all our travelling accompaniments,\\r\\nI must not forget a pocket medicine chest, containing blunt scissors,\\r\\nsplints for broken limbs, a piece of tape of unbleached linen,\\r\\nbandages and compresses, lint, a lancet for bleeding, all dreadful\\r\\narticles to take with one. Then there was a row of phials containing\\r\\ndextrine, alcoholic ether, liquid acetate of lead, vinegar, and\\r\\nammonia drugs which afforded me no comfort. Finally, all the articles\\r\\nneedful to supply Ruhmkorff\\'s apparatus.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle did not forget a supply of tobacco, coarse grained powder,\\r\\nand amadou, nor a leathern belt in which he carried a sufficient\\r\\nquantity of gold, silver, and paper money. Six pairs of boots and\\r\\nshoes, made waterproof with a composition of indiarubber and naphtha,\\r\\nwere packed amongst the tools.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Clothed, shod, and equipped like this,\" said my uncle, \"there is no\\r\\ntelling how far we may go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 14th was wholly spent in arranging all our different articles. In\\r\\nthe evening we dined with Baron Tramps; the mayor of Rejkiavik, and\\r\\nDr. Hyaltalin, the first medical man of the place, being of the\\r\\nparty. M. Fridrikssen was not there. I learned afterwards that he and\\r\\nthe Governor disagreed upon some question of administration, and did\\r\\nnot speak to each other. I therefore knew not a single word of all\\r\\nthat was said at this semi-official dinner; but I could not help\\r\\nnoticing that my uncle talked the whole time.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 15th our preparations were all made. Our host gave the\\r\\nProfessor very great pleasure by presenting him with a map of Iceland\\r\\nfar more complete than that of Hendersen. It was the map of M. Olaf\\r\\nNikolas Olsen, in the proportion of 1 to 480,000 of the actual size\\r\\nof the island, and published by the Icelandic Literary Society. It\\r\\nwas a precious document for a mineralogist.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur last evening was spent in intimate conversation with M.\\r\\nFridrikssen, with whom I felt the liveliest sympathy; then, after the\\r\\ntalk, succeeded, for me, at any rate, a disturbed and restless night.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt five in the morning I was awoke by the neighing and pawing of four\\r\\nhorses under my window. I dressed hastily and came down into the\\r\\nstreet. Hans was finishing our packing, almost as it were without\\r\\nmoving a limb; and yet he did his work cleverly. My uncle made more\\r\\nnoise than execution, and the guide seemed to pay very little\\r\\nattention to his energetic directions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt six o\\'clock our preparations were over. M. Fridrikssen shook hands\\r\\nwith us. My uncle thanked him heartily for his extreme kindness. I\\r\\nconstructed a few fine Latin sentences to express my cordial\\r\\nfarewell. Then we bestrode our steeds and with his last adieu M.\\r\\nFridrikssen treated me to a line of Virgil eminently applicable to\\r\\nsuch uncertain wanderers as we were likely to be:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Et quacumque viam dedent fortuna sequamur.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Therever fortune clears a way,\\r\\nThither our ready footsteps stray.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII.\\r\\n\\r\\nA BARREN LAND\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had started under a sky overcast but calm. There was no fear of\\r\\nheat, none of disastrous rain. It was just the weather for tourists.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pleasure of riding on horseback over an unknown country made me\\r\\neasy to be pleased at our first start. I threw myself wholly into the\\r\\npleasure of the trip, and enjoyed the feeling of freedom and\\r\\nsatisfied desire. I was beginning to take a real share in the\\r\\nenterprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Besides,\" I said to myself, \"where\\'s the risk? Here we are\\r\\ntravelling all through a most interesting country! We are about to\\r\\nclimb a very remarkable mountain; at the worst we are going to\\r\\nscramble down an extinct crater. It is evident that Saknussemm did\\r\\nnothing more than this. As for a passage leading to the centre of the\\r\\nglobe, it is mere rubbish! perfectly impossible! Very well, then; let\\r\\nus get all the good we can out of this expedition, and don\\'t let us\\r\\nhaggle about the chances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis reasoning having settled my mind, we got out of Rejkiavik.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans moved steadily on, keeping ahead of us at an even, smooth, and\\r\\nrapid pace. The baggage horses followed him without giving any\\r\\ntrouble. Then came my uncle and myself, looking not so very\\r\\nill-mounted on our small but hardy animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIceland is one of the largest islands in Europe. Its surface is\\r\\n14,000 square miles, and it contains but 16,000 inhabitants.\\r\\nGeographers have divided it into four quarters, and we were crossing\\r\\ndiagonally the south-west quarter, called the \\'Sudvester Fjordungr.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nOn leaving Rejkiavik Hans took us by the seashore. We passed lean\\r\\npastures which were trying very hard, but in vain, to look green;\\r\\nyellow came out best. The rugged peaks of the trachyte rocks\\r\\npresented faint outlines on the eastern horizon; at times a few\\r\\npatches of snow, concentrating the vague light, glittered upon the\\r\\nslopes of the distant mountains; certain peaks, boldly uprising,\\r\\npassed through the grey clouds, and reappeared above the moving\\r\\nmists, like breakers emerging in the heavens.\\r\\n\\r\\nOften these chains of barren rocks made a dip towards the sea, and\\r\\nencroached upon the scanty pasturage: but there was always enough\\r\\nroom to pass. Besides, our horses instinctively chose the easiest\\r\\nplaces without ever slackening their pace. My uncle was refused even\\r\\nthe satisfaction of stirring up his beast with whip or voice. He had\\r\\nno excuse for being impatient. I could not help smiling to see so\\r\\ntall a man on so small a pony, and as his long legs nearly touched\\r\\nthe ground he looked like a six-legged centaur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good horse! good horse!\" he kept saying. \"You will see, Axel, that\\r\\nthere is no more sagacious animal than the Icelandic horse. He is\\r\\nstopped by neither snow, nor storm, nor impassable roads, nor rocks,\\r\\nglaciers, or anything. He is courageous, sober, and surefooted. He\\r\\nnever makes a false step, never shies. If there is a river or fiord\\r\\nto cross (and we shall meet with many) you will see him plunge in at\\r\\nonce, just as if he were amphibious, and gain the opposite bank. But\\r\\nwe must not hurry him; we must let him have his way, and we shall get\\r\\non at the rate of thirty miles a day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We may; but how about our guide?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, never mind him. People like him get over the ground without a\\r\\nthought. There is so little action in this man that he will never get\\r\\ntired; and besides, if he wants it, he shall have my horse. I shall\\r\\nget cramped if I don\\'t have a little action. The arms are all right,\\r\\nbut the legs want exercise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were advancing at a rapid pace. The country was already almost a\\r\\ndesert. Here and there was a lonely farm, called a boer built either\\r\\nof wood, or of sods, or of pieces of lava, looking like a poor beggar\\r\\nby the wayside. These ruinous huts seemed to solicit charity from\\r\\npassers-by; and on very small provocation we should have given alms\\r\\nfor the relief of the poor inmates. In this country there were no\\r\\nroads and paths, and the poor vegetation, however slow, would soon\\r\\nefface the rare travellers\\' footsteps.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet this part of the province, at a very small distance from the\\r\\ncapital, is reckoned among the inhabited and cultivated portions of\\r\\nIceland. What, then, must other tracts be, more desert than this\\r\\ndesert? In the first half mile we had not seen one farmer standing\\r\\nbefore his cabin door, nor one shepherd tending a flock less wild\\r\\nthan himself, nothing but a few cows and sheep left to themselves.\\r\\nWhat then would be those convulsed regions upon which we were\\r\\nadvancing, regions subject to the dire phenomena of eruptions, the\\r\\noffspring of volcanic explosions and subterranean convulsions?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were to know them before long, but on consulting Olsen\\'s map, I\\r\\nsaw that they would be avoided by winding along the seashore. In\\r\\nfact, the great plutonic action is confined to the central portion of\\r\\nthe island; there, rocks of the trappean and volcanic class,\\r\\nincluding trachyte, basalt, and tuffs and agglomerates associated\\r\\nwith streams of lava, have made this a land of supernatural horrors.\\r\\nI had no idea of the spectacle which was awaiting us in the peninsula\\r\\nof Snaefell, where these ruins of a fiery nature have formed a\\r\\nfrightful chaos.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn two hours from Rejkiavik we arrived at the burgh of Gufunes,\\r\\ncalled Aolkirkja, or principal church. There was nothing remarkable\\r\\nhere but a few houses, scarcely enough for a German hamlet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans stopped here half an hour. He shared with us our frugal\\r\\nbreakfast; answering my uncle\\'s questions about the road and our\\r\\nresting place that night with merely yes or no, except when he said\\r\\n\"Gardaer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI consulted the map to see where Gardaer was. I saw there was a small\\r\\ntown of that name on the banks of the Hvalfiord, four miles from\\r\\nRejkiavik. I showed it to my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Four miles only!\" he exclaimed; \"four miles out of twenty-eight.\\r\\nWhat a nice little walk!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was about to make an observation to the guide, who without\\r\\nanswering resumed his place at the head, and went on his way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree hours later, still treading on the colourless grass of the\\r\\npasture land, we had to work round the Kolla fiord, a longer way but\\r\\nan easier one than across that inlet. We soon entered into a\\r\\n\\'pingstaoer\\' or parish called Ejulberg, from whose steeple twelve\\r\\no\\'clock would have struck, if Icelandic churches were rich enough to\\r\\npossess clocks. But they are like the parishioners who have no\\r\\nwatches and do without.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere our horses were baited; then taking the narrow path to left\\r\\nbetween a chain of hills and the sea, they carried us to our next\\r\\nstage, the aolkirkja of Brantaer and one mile farther on, to Saurboer\\r\\n\\'Annexia,\\' a chapel of ease built on the south shore of the Hvalfiord.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now four o\\'clock, and we had gone four Icelandic miles, or\\r\\ntwenty-four English miles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that place the fiord was at least three English miles wide; the\\r\\nwaves rolled with a rushing din upon the sharp-pointed rocks; this\\r\\ninlet was confined between walls of rock, precipices crowned by sharp\\r\\npeaks 2,000 feet high, and remarkable for the brown strata which\\r\\nseparated the beds of reddish tuff. However much I might respect the\\r\\nintelligence of our quadrupeds, I hardly cared to put it to the test\\r\\nby trusting myself to it on horseback across an arm of the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they are as intelligent as they are said to be, I thought, they\\r\\nwon\\'t try it. In any case, I will tax my intelligence to direct\\r\\ntheirs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut my uncle would not wait. He spurred on to the edge. His steed\\r\\nlowered his head to examine the nearest waves and stopped. My uncle,\\r\\nwho had an instinct of his own, too, applied pressure, and was again\\r\\nrefused by the animal significantly shaking his head. Then followed\\r\\nstrong language, and the whip; but the brute answered these arguments\\r\\nwith kicks and endeavours to throw his rider. At last the clever\\r\\nlittle pony, with a bend of his knees, started from under the\\r\\nProfessor\\'s legs, and left him standing upon two boulders on the\\r\\nshore just like the colossus of Rhodes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Confounded brute!\" cried the unhorsed horseman, suddenly degraded\\r\\ninto a pedestrian, just as ashamed as a cavalry officer degraded to a\\r\\nfoot soldier.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Faerja,_\" said the guide, touching his shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! a boat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Der,_\" replied Hans, pointing to one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" I cried; \"there is a boat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did not you say so then? Well, let us go on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Tidvatten,_\" said the guide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is he saying?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He says tide,\" said my uncle, translating the Danish word.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No doubt we must wait for the tide.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Foerbida,_\" said my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Ja,_\" replied Hans.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle stamped with his foot, while the horses went on to the boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nI perfectly understood the necessity of abiding a particular moment\\r\\nof the tide to undertake the crossing of the fiord, when, the sea\\r\\nhaving reached its greatest height, it should be slack water. Then\\r\\nthe ebb and flow have no sensible effect, and the boat does not risk\\r\\nbeing carried either to the bottom or out to sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat favourable moment arrived only with six o\\'clock; when my uncle,\\r\\nmyself, the guide, two other passengers and the four horses, trusted\\r\\nourselves to a somewhat fragile raft. Accustomed as I was to the\\r\\nswift and sure steamers on the Elbe, I found the oars of the rowers\\r\\nrather a slow means of propulsion. It took us more than an hour to\\r\\ncross the fiord; but the passage was effected without any mishap.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another half hour we had reached the aolkirkja of Gardaer\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nHOSPITALITY UNDER THE ARCTIC CIRCLE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt ought to have been night-time, but under the 65th parallel there\\r\\nwas nothing surprising in the nocturnal polar light. In Iceland\\r\\nduring the months of June and July the sun does not set.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the temperature was much lower. I was cold and more hungry than\\r\\ncold. Welcome was the sight of the boer which was hospitably opened\\r\\nto receive us.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a peasant\\'s house, but in point of hospitality it was equal to\\r\\na king\\'s. On our arrival the master came with outstretched hands, and\\r\\nwithout more ceremony he beckoned us to follow him.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo accompany him down the long, narrow, dark passage, would have been\\r\\nimpossible. Therefore, we followed, as he bid us. The building was\\r\\nconstructed of roughly squared timbers, with rooms on both sides,\\r\\nfour in number, all opening out into the one passage: these were the\\r\\nkitchen, the weaving shop, the badstofa, or family sleeping-room, and\\r\\nthe visitors\\' room, which was the best of all. My uncle, whose height\\r\\nhad not been thought of in building the house, of course hit his head\\r\\nseveral times against the beams that projected from the ceilings.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were introduced into our apartment, a large room with a floor of\\r\\nearth stamped hard down, and lighted by a window, the panes of which\\r\\nwere formed of sheep\\'s bladder, not admitting too much light. The\\r\\nsleeping accommodation consisted of dry litter, thrown into two\\r\\nwooden frames painted red, and ornamented with Icelandic sentences. I\\r\\nwas hardly expecting so much comfort; the only discomfort proceeded\\r\\nfrom the strong odour of dried fish, hung meat, and sour milk, of\\r\\nwhich my nose made bitter complaints.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we had laid aside our travelling wraps the voice of the host was\\r\\nheard inviting us to the kitchen, the only room where a fire was\\r\\nlighted even in the severest cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle lost no time in obeying the friendly call, nor was I slack\\r\\nin following.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kitchen chimney was constructed on the ancient pattern; in the\\r\\nmiddle of the room was a stone for a hearth, over it in the roof a\\r\\nhole to let the smoke escape. The kitchen was also a dining-room.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt our entrance the host, as if he had never seen us, greeted us with\\r\\nthe word \"_Saellvertu,_\" which means \"be happy,\" and came and kissed\\r\\nus on the cheek.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter him his wife pronounced the same words, accompanied with the\\r\\nsame ceremonial; then the two placing their hands upon their hearts,\\r\\ninclined profoundly before us.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hasten to inform the reader that this Icelandic lady was the mother\\r\\nof nineteen children, all, big and little, swarming in the midst of\\r\\nthe dense wreaths of smoke with which the fire on the hearth filled\\r\\nthe chamber. Every moment I noticed a fair-haired and rather\\r\\nmelancholy face peeping out of the rolling volumes of smoke--they\\r\\nwere a perfect cluster of unwashed angels.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle and I treated this little tribe with kindness; and in a very\\r\\nshort time we each had three or four of these brats on our shoulders,\\r\\nas many on our laps, and the rest between our knees. Those who could\\r\\nspeak kept repeating \"_Saellvertu,_\" in every conceivable tone; those\\r\\nthat could not speak made up for that want by shrill cries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis concert was brought to a close by the announcement of dinner. At\\r\\nthat moment our hunter returned, who had been seeing his horses\\r\\nprovided for; that is to say, he had economically let them loose in\\r\\nthe fields, where the poor beasts had to content themselves with the\\r\\nscanty moss they could pull off the rocks and a few meagre sea weeds,\\r\\nand the next day they would not fail to come of themselves and resume\\r\\nthe labours of the previous day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Saellvertu,_\" said Hans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen calmly, automatically, and dispassionately he kissed the host,\\r\\nthe hostess, and their nineteen children.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis ceremony over, we sat at table, twenty-four in number, and\\r\\ntherefore one upon another. The luckiest had only two urchins upon\\r\\ntheir knees.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut silence reigned in all this little world at the arrival of the\\r\\nsoup, and the national taciturnity resumed its empire even over the\\r\\nchildren. The host served out to us a soup made of lichen and by no\\r\\nmeans unpleasant, then an immense piece of dried fish floating in\\r\\nbutter rancid with twenty years\\' keeping, and, therefore, according\\r\\nto Icelandic gastronomy, much preferable to fresh butter. Along with\\r\\nthis, we had \\'skye,\\' a sort of clotted milk, with biscuits, and a\\r\\nliquid prepared from juniper berries; for beverage we had a thin milk\\r\\nmixed with water, called in this country \\'blanda.\\' It is not for me\\r\\nto decide whether this diet is wholesome or not; all I can say is,\\r\\nthat I was desperately hungry, and that at dessert I swallowed to the\\r\\nvery last gulp of a thick broth made from buckwheat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the meal was over the children disappeared, and their\\r\\nelders gathered round the peat fire, which also burnt such\\r\\nmiscellaneous fuel as briars, cow-dung, and fishbones. After this\\r\\nlittle pinch of warmth the different groups retired to their\\r\\nrespective rooms. Our hostess hospitably offered us her assistance in\\r\\nundressing, according to Icelandic usage; but on our gracefully\\r\\ndeclining, she insisted no longer, and I was able at last to curl\\r\\nmyself up in my mossy bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt five next morning we bade our host farewell, my uncle with\\r\\ndifficulty persuading him to accept a proper remuneration; and Hans\\r\\nsignalled the start.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a hundred yards from Gardaer the soil began to change its aspect;\\r\\nit became boggy and less favourable to progress. On our right the\\r\\nchain of mountains was indefinitely prolonged like an immense system\\r\\nof natural fortifications, of which we were following the\\r\\ncounter-scarp or lesser steep; often we were met by streams, which we\\r\\nhad to ford with great care, not to wet our packages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe desert became wider and more hideous; yet from time to time we\\r\\nseemed to descry a human figure that fled at our approach, sometimes\\r\\na sharp turn would bring us suddenly within a short distance of one\\r\\nof these spectres, and I was filled with loathing at the sight of a\\r\\nhuge deformed head, the skin shining and hairless, and repulsive\\r\\nsores visible through the gaps in the poor creature\\'s wretched rags.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unhappy being forbore to approach us and offer his misshapen\\r\\nhand. He fled away, but not before Hans had saluted him with the\\r\\ncustomary \"_Saellvertu._\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Spetelsk,_\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A leper!\" my uncle repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis word produced a repulsive effect. The horrible disease of\\r\\nleprosy is too common in Iceland; it is not contagious, but\\r\\nhereditary, and lepers are forbidden to marry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese apparitions were not cheerful, and did not throw any charm over\\r\\nthe less and less attractive landscapes. The last tufts of grass had\\r\\ndisappeared from beneath our feet. Not a tree was to be seen, unless\\r\\nwe except a few dwarf birches as low as brushwood. Not an animal but\\r\\na few wandering ponies that their owners would not feed. Sometimes we\\r\\ncould see a hawk balancing himself on his wings under the grey cloud,\\r\\nand then darting away south with rapid flight. I felt melancholy\\r\\nunder this savage aspect of nature, and my thoughts went away to the\\r\\ncheerful scenes I had left in the far south.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had to cross a few narrow fiords, and at last quite a wide gulf;\\r\\nthe tide, then high, allowed us to pass over without delay, and to\\r\\nreach the hamlet of Alftanes, one mile beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat evening, after having forded two rivers full of trout and pike,\\r\\ncalled Alfa and Heta, we were obliged to spend the night in a\\r\\ndeserted building worthy to be haunted by all the elfins of\\r\\nScandinavia. The ice king certainly held court here, and gave us all\\r\\nnight long samples of what he could do.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo particular event marked the next day. Bogs, dead levels,\\r\\nmelancholy desert tracks, wherever we travelled. By nightfall we had\\r\\naccomplished half our journey, and we lay at Kroesolbt.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 19th of June, for about a mile, that is an Icelandic mile, we\\r\\nwalked upon hardened lava; this ground is called in the country\\r\\n\\'hraun\\'; the writhen surface presented the appearance of distorted,\\r\\ntwisted cables, sometimes stretched in length, sometimes contorted\\r\\ntogether; an immense torrent, once liquid, now solid, ran from the\\r\\nnearest mountains, now extinct volcanoes, but the ruins around\\r\\nrevealed the violence of the past eruptions. Yet here and there were\\r\\na few jets of steam from hot springs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had no time to watch these phenomena; we had to proceed on our\\r\\nway. Soon at the foot of the mountains the boggy land reappeared,\\r\\nintersected by little lakes. Our route now lay westward; we had\\r\\nturned the great bay of Faxa, and the twin peaks of Snaefell rose\\r\\nwhite into the cloudy sky at the distance of at least five miles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe horses did their duty well, no difficulties stopped them in their\\r\\nsteady career. I was getting tired; but my uncle was as firm and\\r\\nstraight as he was at our first start. I could not help admiring his\\r\\npersistency, as well as the hunter\\'s, who treated our expedition like\\r\\na mere promenade.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 20. At six p.m. we reached Buedir, a village on the sea shore;\\r\\nand the guide there claiming his due, my uncle settled with him. It\\r\\nwas Hans\\' own family, that is, his uncles and cousins, who gave us\\r\\nhospitality; we were kindly received, and without taxing too much the\\r\\ngoodness of these folks, I would willingly have tarried here to\\r\\nrecruit after my fatigues. But my uncle, who wanted no recruiting,\\r\\nwould not hear of it, and the next morning we had to bestride our\\r\\nbeasts again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soil told of the neighbourhood of the mountain, whose granite\\r\\nfoundations rose from the earth like the knotted roots of some huge\\r\\noak. We were rounding the immense base of the volcano. The Professor\\r\\nhardly took his eyes off it. He tossed up his arms and seemed to defy\\r\\nit, and to declare, \"There stands the giant that I shall conquer.\"\\r\\nAfter about four hours\\' walking the horses stopped of their own\\r\\naccord at the door of the priest\\'s house at Stapi.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nBUT ARCTICS CAN BE INHOSPITABLE, TOO\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStapi is a village consisting of about thirty huts, built of lava, at\\r\\nthe south side of the base of the volcano. It extends along the inner\\r\\nedge of a small fiord, inclosed between basaltic walls of the\\r\\nstrangest construction.\\r\\n\\r\\nBasalt is a brownish rock of igneous origin. It assumes regular\\r\\nforms, the arrangement of which is often very surprising. Here nature\\r\\nhad done her work geometrically, with square and compass and plummet.\\r\\nEverywhere else her art consists alone in throwing down huge masses\\r\\ntogether in disorder. You see cones imperfectly formed, irregular\\r\\npyramids, with a fantastic disarrangement of lines; but here, as if\\r\\nto exhibit an example of regularity, though in advance of the very\\r\\nearliest architects, she has created a severely simple order of\\r\\narchitecture, never surpassed either by the splendours of Babylon or\\r\\nthe wonders of Greece.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had heard of the Giant\\'s Causeway in Ireland, and Fingal\\'s Cave in\\r\\nStaffa, one of the Hebrides; but I had never yet seen a basaltic\\r\\nformation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Stapi I beheld this phenomenon in all its beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wall that confined the fiord, like all the coast of the\\r\\npeninsula, was composed of a series of vertical columns thirty feet\\r\\nhigh. These straight shafts, of fair proportions, supported an\\r\\narchitrave of horizontal slabs, the overhanging portion of which\\r\\nformed a semi-arch over the sea. At intervals, under this natural\\r\\nshelter, there spread out vaulted entrances in beautiful curves, into\\r\\nwhich the waves came dashing with foam and spray. A few shafts of\\r\\nbasalt, torn from their hold by the fury of tempests, lay along the\\r\\nsoil like remains of an ancient temple, in ruins for ever fresh, and\\r\\nover which centuries passed without leaving a trace of age upon them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was our last stage upon the earth. Hans had exhibited great\\r\\nintelligence, and it gave me some little comfort to think then that\\r\\nhe was not going to leave us.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn arriving at the door of the rector\\'s house, which was not\\r\\ndifferent from the others, I saw a man shoeing a horse, hammer in\\r\\nhand, and with a leathern apron on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Saellvertu,_\" said the hunter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_God dag,_\" said the blacksmith in good Danish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Kyrkoherde,_\" said Hans, turning round to my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The rector,\" repeated the Professor. \"It seems, Axel, that this good\\r\\nman is the rector.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOur guide in the meanwhile was making the \\'kyrkoherde\\' aware of the\\r\\nposition of things; when the latter, suspending his labours for a\\r\\nmoment, uttered a sound no doubt understood between horses and\\r\\nfarriers, and immediately a tall and ugly hag appeared from the hut.\\r\\nShe must have been six feet at the least. I was in great alarm lest\\r\\nshe should treat me to the Icelandic kiss; but there was no occasion\\r\\nto fear, nor did she do the honours at all too gracefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visitors\\' room seemed to me the worst in the whole cabin. It was\\r\\nclose, dirty, and evil smelling. But we had to be content. The rector\\r\\ndid not to go in for antique hospitality. Very far from it. Before\\r\\nthe day was over I saw that we had to do with a blacksmith, a\\r\\nfisherman, a hunter, a joiner, but not at all with a minister of the\\r\\nGospel. To be sure, it was a week-day; perhaps on a Sunday he made\\r\\namends.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t mean to say anything against these poor priests, who after\\r\\nall are very wretched. They receive from the Danish Government a\\r\\nridiculously small pittance, and they get from the parish the fourth\\r\\npart of the tithe, which does not come to sixty marks a year (about\\r\\nL4). Hence the necessity to work for their livelihood; but after\\r\\nfishing, hunting, and shoeing horses for any length of time, one soon\\r\\ngets into the ways and manners of fishermen, hunters, and farriers,\\r\\nand other rather rude and uncultivated people; and that evening I\\r\\nfound out that temperance was not among the virtues that\\r\\ndistinguished my host.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle soon discovered what sort of a man he had to do with;\\r\\ninstead of a good and learned man he found a rude and coarse peasant.\\r\\nHe therefore resolved to commence the grand expedition at once, and\\r\\nto leave this inhospitable parsonage. He cared nothing about fatigue,\\r\\nand resolved to spend some days upon the mountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe preparations for our departure were therefore made the very day\\r\\nafter our arrival at Stapi. Hans hired the services of three\\r\\nIcelanders to do the duty of the horses in the transport of the\\r\\nburdens; but as soon as we had arrived at the crater these natives\\r\\nwere to turn back and leave us to our own devices. This was to be\\r\\nclearly understood.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle now took the opportunity to explain to Hans that it was his\\r\\nintention to explore the interior of the volcano to its farthest\\r\\nlimits.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans merely nodded. There or elsewhere, down in the bowels of the\\r\\nearth, or anywhere on the surface, all was alike to him. For my own\\r\\npart the incidents of the journey had hitherto kept me amused, and\\r\\nmade me forgetful of coming evils; but now my fears again were\\r\\nbeginning to get the better of me. But what could I do? The place to\\r\\nresist the Professor would have been Hamburg, not the foot of Snaefell.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thought, above all others, harassed and alarmed me; it was one\\r\\ncalculated to shake firmer nerves than mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, thought I, here we are, about to climb Snaefell. Very good. We\\r\\nwill explore the crater. Very good, too, others have done as much\\r\\nwithout dying for it. But that is not all. If there is a way to\\r\\npenetrate into the very bowels of the island, if that ill-advised\\r\\nSaknussemm has told a true tale, we shall lose our way amidst the\\r\\ndeep subterranean passages of this volcano. Now, there is no proof\\r\\nthat Snaefell is extinct. Who can assure us that an eruption is not\\r\\nbrewing at this very moment? Does it follow that because the monster\\r\\nhas slept since 1229 he must therefore never awake again? And if he\\r\\nwakes up presently, where shall we be?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was worth while debating this question, and I did debate it. I\\r\\ncould not sleep for dreaming about eruptions. Now, the part of\\r\\nejected scoriae and ashes seemed to my mind a very rough one to act.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, at last, when I could hold out no longer, I resolved to lay the\\r\\ncase before my uncle, as prudently and as cautiously as possible,\\r\\njust under the form of an almost impossible hypothesis.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went to him. I communicated my fears to him, and drew back a step\\r\\nto give him room for the explosion which I knew must follow. But I\\r\\nwas mistaken.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was thinking of that,\" he replied with great simplicity.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat could those words mean?--Was he actually going to listen to\\r\\nreason? Was he contemplating the abandonment of his plans? This was\\r\\ntoo good to be true.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few moments\\' silence, during which I dared not question him,\\r\\nhe resumed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was thinking of that. Ever since we arrived at Stapi I have been\\r\\noccupied with the important question you have just opened, for we\\r\\nmust not be guilty of imprudence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed!\" I replied with forcible emphasis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For six hundred years Snaefell has been dumb; but he may speak again.\\r\\nNow, eruptions are always preceded by certain well-known phenomena. I\\r\\nhave therefore examined the natives, I have studied external\\r\\nappearances, and I can assure you, Axel, that there will be no\\r\\neruption.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this positive affirmation I stood amazed and speechless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t doubt my word?\" said my uncle. \"Well, follow me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI obeyed like an automaton. Coming out from the priest\\'s house, the\\r\\nProfessor took a straight road, which, through an opening in the\\r\\nbasaltic wall, led away from the sea. We were soon in the open\\r\\ncountry, if one may give that name to a vast extent of mounds of\\r\\nvolcanic products. This tract seemed crushed under a rain of enormous\\r\\nejected rocks of trap, basalt, granite, and all kinds of igneous\\r\\nrocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere and there I could see puffs and jets of steam curling up into\\r\\nthe air, called in Icelandic \\'reykir,\\' issuing from thermal springs,\\r\\nand indicating by their motion the volcanic energy underneath. This\\r\\nseemed to justify my fears: But I fell from the height of my new-born\\r\\nhopes when my uncle said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see all these volumes of steam, Axel; well, they demonstrate\\r\\nthat we have nothing to fear from the fury of a volcanic eruption.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Am I to believe that?\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Understand this clearly,\" added the Professor. \"At the approach of\\r\\nan eruption these jets would redouble their activity, but disappear\\r\\naltogether during the period of the eruption. For the elastic fluids,\\r\\nbeing no longer under pressure, go off by way of the crater instead\\r\\nof escaping by their usual passages through the fissures in the soil.\\r\\nTherefore, if these vapours remain in their usual condition, if they\\r\\ndisplay no augmentation of force, and if you add to this the\\r\\nobservation that the wind and rain are not ceasing and being replaced\\r\\nby a still and heavy atmosphere, then you may affirm that no eruption\\r\\nis preparing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'No more; that is sufficient. When science has uttered her voice, let\\r\\nbabblers hold their peace.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nI returned to the parsonage, very crestfallen. My uncle had beaten me\\r\\nwith the weapons of science. Still I had one hope left, and this was,\\r\\nthat when we had reached the bottom of the crater it would be\\r\\nimpossible, for want of a passage, to go deeper, in spite of all the\\r\\nSaknussemm\\'s in Iceland.\\r\\n\\r\\nI spent that whole night in one constant nightmare; in the heart of a\\r\\nvolcano, and from the deepest depths of the earth I saw myself tossed\\r\\nup amongst the interplanetary spaces under the form of an eruptive\\r\\nrock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, June 23, Hans was awaiting us with his companions\\r\\ncarrying provisions, tools, and instruments; two iron pointed sticks,\\r\\ntwo rifles, and two shot belts were for my uncle and myself. Hans, as\\r\\na cautious man, had added to our luggage a leathern bottle full of\\r\\nwater, which, with that in our flasks, would ensure us a supply of\\r\\nwater for eight days.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was nine in the morning. The priest and his tall Megaera were\\r\\nawaiting us at the door. We supposed they were standing there to bid\\r\\nus a kind farewell. But the farewell was put in the unexpected form\\r\\nof a heavy bill, in which everything was charged, even to the very\\r\\nair we breathed in the pastoral house, infected as it was. This\\r\\nworthy couple were fleecing us just as a Swiss innkeeper might have\\r\\ndone, and estimated their imperfect hospitality at the highest price.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle paid without a remark: a man who is starting for the centre\\r\\nof the earth need not be particular about a few rix dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis point being settled, Hans gave the signal, and we soon left\\r\\nStapi behind us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV.\\r\\n\\r\\nSNAEFELL AT LAST\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSnaefell is 5,000 feet high. Its double cone forms the limit of a\\r\\ntrachytic belt which stands out distinctly in the mountain system of\\r\\nthe island. From our starting point we could see the two peaks boldly\\r\\nprojected against the dark grey sky; I could see an enormous cap of\\r\\nsnow coming low down upon the giant\\'s brow.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe walked in single file, headed by the hunter, who ascended by\\r\\nnarrow tracks, where two could not have gone abreast. There was\\r\\ntherefore no room for conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter we had passed the basaltic wall of the fiord of Stapi we passed\\r\\nover a vegetable fibrous peat bog, left from the ancient vegetation\\r\\nof this peninsula. The vast quantity of this unworked fuel would be\\r\\nsufficient to warm the whole population of Iceland for a century;\\r\\nthis vast turbary measured in certain ravines had in many places a\\r\\ndepth of seventy feet, and presented layers of carbonized remains of\\r\\nvegetation alternating with thinner layers of tufaceous pumice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a true nephew of the Professor Liedenbrock, and in spite of my\\r\\ndismal prospects, I could not help observing with interest the\\r\\nmineralogical curiosities which lay about me as in a vast museum, and\\r\\nI constructed for myself a complete geological account of Iceland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis most curious island has evidently been projected from the bottom\\r\\nof the sea at a comparatively recent date. Possibly, it may still be\\r\\nsubject to gradual elevation. If this is the case, its origin may\\r\\nwell be attributed to subterranean fires. Therefore, in this case,\\r\\nthe theory of Sir Humphry Davy, Saknussemm\\'s document, and my uncle\\'s\\r\\ntheories would all go off in smoke. This hypothesis led me to examine\\r\\nwith more attention the appearance of the surface, and I soon arrived\\r\\nat a conclusion as to the nature of the forces which presided at its\\r\\nbirth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIceland, which is entirely devoid of alluvial soil, is wholly\\r\\ncomposed of volcanic tufa, that is to say, an agglomeration of porous\\r\\nrocks and stones. Before the volcanoes broke out it consisted of trap\\r\\nrocks slowly upraised to the level of the sea by the action of\\r\\ncentral forces. The internal fires had not yet forced their way\\r\\nthrough.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at a later period a wide chasm formed diagonally from south-west\\r\\nto north-east, through which was gradually forced out the trachyte\\r\\nwhich was to form a mountain chain. No violence accompanied this\\r\\nchange; the matter thrown out was in vast quantities, and the liquid\\r\\nmaterial oozing out from the abysses of the earth slowly spread in\\r\\nextensive plains or in hillocky masses. To this period belong the\\r\\nfelspar, syenites, and porphyries.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut with the help of this outflow the thickness of the crust of the\\r\\nisland increased materially, and therefore also its powers of\\r\\nresistance. It may easily be conceived what vast quantities of\\r\\nelastic gases, what masses of molten matter accumulated beneath its\\r\\nsolid surface whilst no exit was practicable after the cooling of the\\r\\ntrachytic crust. Therefore a time would come when the elastic and\\r\\nexplosive forces of the imprisoned gases would upheave this ponderous\\r\\ncover and drive out for themselves openings through tall chimneys.\\r\\nHence then the volcano would distend and lift up the crust, and then\\r\\nburst through a crater suddenly formed at the summit or thinnest part\\r\\nof the volcano.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the eruption succeeded other volcanic phenomena. Through the\\r\\noutlets now made first escaped the ejected basalt of which the plain\\r\\nwe had just left presented such marvellous specimens. We were moving\\r\\nover grey rocks of dense and massive formation, which in cooling had\\r\\nformed into hexagonal prisms. Everywhere around us we saw truncated\\r\\ncones, formerly so many fiery mouths.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the exhaustion of the basalt, the volcano, the power of which\\r\\ngrew by the extinction of the lesser craters, supplied an egress to\\r\\nlava, ashes, and scoriae, of which I could see lengthened screes\\r\\nstreaming down the sides of the mountain like flowing hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was the succession of phenomena which produced Iceland, all\\r\\narising from the action of internal fire; and to suppose that the\\r\\nmass within did not still exist in a state of liquid incandescence\\r\\nwas absurd; and nothing could surpass the absurdity of fancying that\\r\\nit was possible to reach the earth\\'s centre.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I felt a little comforted as we advanced to the assault of Snaefell.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe way was growing more and more arduous, the ascent steeper and\\r\\nsteeper; the loose fragments of rock trembled beneath us, and the\\r\\nutmost care was needed to avoid dangerous falls.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans went on as quietly as if he were on level ground; sometimes he\\r\\ndisappeared altogether behind the huge blocks, then a shrill whistle\\r\\nwould direct us on our way to him. Sometimes he would halt, pick up a\\r\\nfew bits of stone, build them up into a recognisable form, and thus\\r\\nmade landmarks to guide us in our way back. A very wise precaution in\\r\\nitself, but, as things turned out, quite useless.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree hours\\' fatiguing march had only brought us to the base of the\\r\\nmountain. There Hans bid us come to a halt, and a hasty breakfast was\\r\\nserved out. My uncle swallowed two mouthfuls at a time to get on\\r\\nfaster. But, whether he liked it or not, this was a rest as well as a\\r\\nbreakfast hour and he had to wait till it pleased our guide to move\\r\\non, which came to pass in an hour. The three Icelanders, just as\\r\\ntaciturn as their comrade the hunter, never spoke, and ate their\\r\\nbreakfasts in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were now beginning to scale the steep sides of Snaefell. Its snowy\\r\\nsummit, by an optical illusion not unfrequent in mountains, seemed\\r\\nclose to us, and yet how many weary hours it took to reach it! The\\r\\nstones, adhering by no soil or fibrous roots of vegetation, rolled\\r\\naway from under our feet, and rushed down the precipice below with\\r\\nthe swiftness of an avalanche.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt some places the flanks of the mountain formed an angle with the\\r\\nhorizon of at least 36 degrees; it was impossible to climb them, and\\r\\nthese stony cliffs had to be tacked round, not without great\\r\\ndifficulty. Then we helped each other with our sticks.\\r\\n\\r\\nI must admit that my uncle kept as close to me as he could; he never\\r\\nlost sight of me, and in many straits his arm furnished me with a\\r\\npowerful support. He himself seemed to possess an instinct for\\r\\nequilibrium, for he never stumbled. The Icelanders, though burdened\\r\\nwith our loads, climbed with the agility of mountaineers.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo judge by the distant appearance of the summit of Snaefell, it would\\r\\nhave seemed too steep to ascend on our side. Fortunately, after an\\r\\nhour of fatigue and athletic exercises, in the midst of the vast\\r\\nsurface of snow presented by the hollow between the two peaks, a kind\\r\\nof staircase appeared unexpectedly which greatly facilitated our\\r\\nascent. It was formed by one of those torrents of stones flung up by\\r\\nthe eruptions, called \\'sting\\' by the Icelanders. If this torrent had\\r\\nnot been arrested in its fall by the formation of the sides of the\\r\\nmountain, it would have gone on to the sea and formed more islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch as it was, it did us good service. The steepness increased, but\\r\\nthese stone steps allowed us to rise with facility, and even with\\r\\nsuch rapidity that, having rested for a moment while my companions\\r\\ncontinued their ascent, I perceived them already reduced by distance\\r\\nto microscopic dimensions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt seven we had ascended the two thousand steps of this grand\\r\\nstaircase, and we had attained a bulge in the mountain, a kind of bed\\r\\non which rested the cone proper of the crater.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree thousand two hundred feet below us stretched the sea. We had\\r\\npassed the limit of perpetual snow, which, on account of the moisture\\r\\nof the climate, is at a greater elevation in Iceland than the high\\r\\nlatitude would give reason to suppose. The cold was excessively keen.\\r\\nThe wind was blowing violently. I was exhausted. The Professor saw\\r\\nthat my limbs were refusing to perform their office, and in spite of\\r\\nhis impatience he decided on stopping. He therefore spoke to the\\r\\nhunter, who shook his head, saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Ofvanfoer._\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It seems we must go higher,\" said my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he asked Hans for his reason.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Mistour,_\" replied the guide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Ja Mistour,_\" said one of the Icelanders in a tone of alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does that word mean?\" I asked uneasily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look!\" said my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked down upon the plain. An immense column of pulverized pumice,\\r\\nsand and dust was rising with a whirling circular motion like a\\r\\nwaterspout; the wind was lashing it on to that side of Snaefell where\\r\\nwe were holding on; this dense veil, hung across the sun, threw a\\r\\ndeep shadow over the mountain. If that huge revolving pillar sloped\\r\\ndown, it would involve us in its whirling eddies. This phenomenon,\\r\\nwhich is not unfrequent when the wind blows from the glaciers, is\\r\\ncalled in Icelandic \\'mistour.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Hastigt! hastigt!_\" cried our guide.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout knowing Danish I understood at once that we must follow Hans\\r\\nat the top of our speed. He began to circle round the cone of the\\r\\ncrater, but in a diagonal direction so as to facilitate our progress.\\r\\nPresently the dust storm fell upon the mountain, which quivered under\\r\\nthe shock; the loose stones, caught with the irresistible blasts of\\r\\nwind, flew about in a perfect hail as in an eruption. Happily we were\\r\\non the opposite side, and sheltered from all harm. But for the\\r\\nprecaution of our guide, our mangled bodies, torn and pounded into\\r\\nfragments, would have been carried afar like the ruins hurled along\\r\\nby some unknown meteor.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet Hans did not think it prudent to spend the night upon the sides\\r\\nof the cone. We continued our zigzag climb. The fifteen hundred\\r\\nremaining feet took us five hours to clear; the circuitous route, the\\r\\ndiagonal and the counter marches, must have measured at least three\\r\\nleagues. I could stand it no longer. I was yielding to the effects of\\r\\nhunger and cold. The rarefied air scarcely gave play to the action of\\r\\nmy lungs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, at eleven in the sunlight night, the summit of Snaefell was\\r\\nreached, and before going in for shelter into the crater I had time\\r\\nto observe the midnight sun, at his lowest point, gilding with his\\r\\npale rays the island that slept at my feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOLDLY DOWN THE CRATER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSupper was rapidly devoured, and the little company housed themselves\\r\\nas best they could. The bed was hard, the shelter not very\\r\\nsubstantial, and our position an anxious one, at five thousand feet\\r\\nabove the sea level. Yet I slept particularly well; it was one of the\\r\\nbest nights I had ever had, and I did not even dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning we awoke half frozen by the sharp keen air, but with the\\r\\nlight of a splendid sun. I rose from my granite bed and went out to\\r\\nenjoy the magnificent spectacle that lay unrolled before me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stood on the very summit of the southernmost of Snaefell\\'s peaks.\\r\\nThe range of the eye extended over the whole island. By an optical\\r\\nlaw which obtains at all great heights, the shores seemed raised and\\r\\nthe centre depressed. It seemed as if one of Helbesmer\\'s raised maps\\r\\nlay at my feet. I could see deep valleys intersecting each other in\\r\\nevery direction, precipices like low walls, lakes reduced to ponds,\\r\\nrivers abbreviated into streams. On my right were numberless glaciers\\r\\nand innumerable peaks, some plumed with feathery clouds of smoke. The\\r\\nundulating surface of these endless mountains, crested with sheets of\\r\\nsnow, reminded one of a stormy sea. If I looked westward, there the\\r\\nocean lay spread out in all its magnificence, like a mere\\r\\ncontinuation of those flock-like summits. The eye could hardly tell\\r\\nwhere the snowy ridges ended and the foaming waves began.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was thus steeped in the marvellous ecstasy which all high summits\\r\\ndevelop in the mind; and now without giddiness, for I was beginning\\r\\nto be accustomed to these sublime aspects of nature. My dazzled eyes\\r\\nwere bathed in the bright flood of the solar rays. I was forgetting\\r\\nwhere and who I was, to live the life of elves and sylphs, the\\r\\nfanciful creation of Scandinavian superstitions. I felt intoxicated\\r\\nwith the sublime pleasure of lofty elevations without thinking of the\\r\\nprofound abysses into which I was shortly to be plunged. But I was\\r\\nbrought back to the realities of things by the arrival of Hans and\\r\\nthe Professor, who joined me on the summit.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle pointed out to me in the far west a light steam or mist, a\\r\\nsemblance of land, which bounded the distant horizon of waters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Greenland!\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Greenland?\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; we are only thirty-five leagues from it; and during thaws the\\r\\nwhite bears, borne by the ice fields from the north, are carried even\\r\\ninto Iceland. But never mind that. Here we are at the top of Snaefell\\r\\nand here are two peaks, one north and one south. Hans will tell us\\r\\nthe name of that on which we are now standing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question being put, Hans replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Scartaris.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle shot a triumphant glance at me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now for the crater!\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crater of Snaefell resembled an inverted cone, the opening of which\\r\\nmight be half a league in diameter. Its depth appeared to be about\\r\\ntwo thousand feet. Imagine the aspect of such a reservoir, brim full\\r\\nand running over with liquid fire amid the rolling thunder. The\\r\\nbottom of the funnel was about 250 feet in circuit, so that the\\r\\ngentle slope allowed its lower brim to be reached without much\\r\\ndifficulty. Involuntarily I compared the whole crater to an enormous\\r\\nerected mortar, and the comparison put me in a terrible fright.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What madness,\" I thought, \"to go down into a mortar, perhaps a\\r\\nloaded mortar, to be shot up into the air at a moment\\'s notice!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I did not try to back out of it. Hans with perfect coolness\\r\\nresumed the lead, and I followed him without a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to facilitate the descent, Hans wound his way down the cone\\r\\nby a spiral path. Our route lay amidst eruptive rocks, some of which,\\r\\nshaken out of their loosened beds, rushed bounding down the abyss,\\r\\nand in their fall awoke echoes remarkable for their loud and\\r\\nwell-defined sharpness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn certain parts of the cone there were glaciers. Here Hans advanced\\r\\nonly with extreme precaution, sounding his way with his iron-pointed\\r\\npole, to discover any crevasses in it. At particularly dubious\\r\\npassages we were obliged to connect ourselves with each other by a\\r\\nlong cord, in order that any man who missed his footing might be held\\r\\nup by his companions. This solid formation was prudent, but did not\\r\\nremove all danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, notwithstanding the difficulties of the descent, down steeps\\r\\nunknown to the guide, the journey was accomplished without accidents,\\r\\nexcept the loss of a coil of rope, which escaped from the hands of an\\r\\nIcelander, and took the shortest way to the bottom of the abyss.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt mid-day we arrived. I raised my head and saw straight above me the\\r\\nupper aperture of the cone, framing a bit of sky of very small\\r\\ncircumference, but almost perfectly round. Just upon the edge\\r\\nappeared the snowy peak of Saris, standing out sharp and clear\\r\\nagainst endless space.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the bottom of the crater were three chimneys, through which, in\\r\\nits eruptions, Snaefell had driven forth fire and lava from its\\r\\ncentral furnace. Each of these chimneys was a hundred feet in\\r\\ndiameter. They gaped before us right in our path. I had not the\\r\\ncourage to look down either of them. But Professor Liedenbrock had\\r\\nhastily surveyed all three; he was panting, running from one to the\\r\\nother, gesticulating, and uttering incoherent expressions. Hans and\\r\\nhis comrades, seated upon loose lava rocks, looked at him with as much\\r\\nwonder as they knew how to express, and perhaps taking him for an\\r\\nescaped lunatic.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly my uncle uttered a cry. I thought his foot must have slipped\\r\\nand that he had fallen down one of the holes. But, no; I saw him,\\r\\nwith arms outstretched and legs straddling wide apart, erect before a\\r\\ngranite rock that stood in the centre of the crater, just like a\\r\\npedestal made ready to receive a statue of Pluto. He stood like a man\\r\\nstupefied, but the stupefaction soon gave way to delirious rapture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Axel, Axel,\" he cried. \"Come, come!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI ran. Hans and the Icelanders never stirred.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look!\" cried the Professor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, sharing his astonishment, but I think not his joy, I read on the\\r\\nwestern face of the block, in Runic characters, half mouldered away\\r\\nwith lapse of ages, this thrice-accursed name:\\r\\n\\r\\n[At this point a Runic text appears]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Arne Saknussemm!\" replied my uncle. \"Do you yet doubt?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI made no answer; and I returned in silence to my lava seat in a\\r\\nstate of utter speechless consternation. Here was crushing evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long I remained plunged in agonizing reflections I cannot tell;\\r\\nall that I know is, that on raising my head again, I saw only my\\r\\nuncle and Hans at the bottom of the crater. The Icelanders had been\\r\\ndismissed, and they were now descending the outer slopes of Snaefell\\r\\nto return to Stapi.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans slept peaceably at the foot of a rock, in a lava bed, where he\\r\\nhad found a suitable couch for himself; but my uncle was pacing\\r\\naround the bottom of the crater like a wild beast in a cage. I had\\r\\nneither the wish nor the strength to rise, and following the guide\\'s\\r\\nexample I went off into an unhappy slumber, fancying I could hear\\r\\nominous noises or feel tremblings within the recesses of the mountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the first night in the crater passed away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, a grey, heavy, cloudy sky seemed to droop over the\\r\\nsummit of the cone. I did not know this first from the appearances of\\r\\nnature, but I found it out by my uncle\\'s impetuous wrath.\\r\\n\\r\\nI soon found out the cause, and hope dawned again in my heart. For\\r\\nthis reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the three ways open before us, one had been taken by Saknussemm.\\r\\nThe indications of the learned Icelander hinted at in the cryptogram,\\r\\npointed to this fact that the shadow of Scartaris came to touch that\\r\\nparticular way during the latter days of the month of June.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat sharp peak might hence be considered as the gnomon of a vast sun\\r\\ndial, the shadow projected from which on a certain day would point\\r\\nout the road to the centre of the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, no sun no shadow, and therefore no guide. Here was June 25. If\\r\\nthe sun was clouded for six days we must postpone our visit till next\\r\\nyear.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy limited powers of description would fail, were I to attempt a\\r\\npicture of the Professor\\'s angry impatience. The day wore on, and no\\r\\nshadow came to lay itself along the bottom of the crater. Hans did\\r\\nnot move from the spot he had selected; yet he must be asking himself\\r\\nwhat were we waiting for, if he asked himself anything at all. My\\r\\nuncle spoke not a word to me. His gaze, ever directed upwards, was\\r\\nlost in the grey and misty space beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 26th nothing yet. Rain mingled with snow was falling all day\\r\\nlong. Hans built a hut of pieces of lava. I felt a malicious pleasure\\r\\nin watching the thousand rills and cascades that came tumbling down\\r\\nthe sides of the cone, and the deafening continuous din awaked by\\r\\nevery stone against which they bounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle\\'s rage knew no bounds. It was enough to irritate a meeker\\r\\nman than he; for it was foundering almost within the port.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Heaven never sends unmixed grief, and for Professor Liedenbrock\\r\\nthere was a satisfaction in store proportioned to his desperate\\r\\nanxieties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day the sky was again overcast; but on the 29th of June, the\\r\\nlast day but one of the month, with the change of the moon came a\\r\\nchange of weather. The sun poured a flood of light down the crater.\\r\\nEvery hillock, every rock and stone, every projecting surface, had\\r\\nits share of the beaming torrent, and threw its shadow on the ground.\\r\\nAmongst them all, Scartaris laid down his sharp-pointed angular\\r\\nshadow which began to move slowly in the opposite direction to that\\r\\nof the radiant orb.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle turned too, and followed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt noon, being at its least extent, it came and softly fell upon the\\r\\nedge of the middle chimney.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There it is! there it is!\" shouted the Professor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now for the centre of the globe!\" he added in Danish.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at Hans, to hear what he would say.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Foruet!_\" was his tranquil answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Forward!\" replied my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was thirteen minutes past one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nVERTICAL DESCENT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow began our real journey. Hitherto our toil had overcome all\\r\\ndifficulties, now difficulties would spring up at every step.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had not yet ventured to look down the bottomless pit into which I\\r\\nwas about to take a plunge. The supreme hour had come. I might now\\r\\neither share in the enterprise or refuse to move forward. But I was\\r\\nashamed to recoil in the presence of the hunter. Hans accepted the\\r\\nenterprise with such calmness, such indifference, such perfect\\r\\ndisregard of any possible danger that I blushed at the idea of being\\r\\nless brave than he. If I had been alone I might have once more tried\\r\\nthe effect of argument; but in the presence of the guide I held my\\r\\npeace; my heart flew back to my sweet Virlandaise, and I approached\\r\\nthe central chimney.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have already mentioned that it was a hundred feet in diameter, and\\r\\nthree hundred feet round. I bent over a projecting rock and gazed\\r\\ndown. My hair stood on end with terror. The bewildering feeling of\\r\\nvacuity laid hold upon me. I felt my centre of gravity shifting its\\r\\nplace, and giddiness mounting into my brain like drunkenness. There\\r\\nis nothing more treacherous than this attraction down deep abysses. I\\r\\nwas just about to drop down, when a hand laid hold of me. It was that\\r\\nof Hans. I suppose I had not taken as many lessons on gulf\\r\\nexploration as I ought to have done in the Frelsers Kirk at\\r\\nCopenhagen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, however short was my examination of this well, I had taken some\\r\\naccount of its conformation. Its almost perpendicular walls were\\r\\nbristling with innumerable projections which would facilitate the\\r\\ndescent. But if there was no want of steps, still there was no rail.\\r\\nA rope fastened to the edge of the aperture might have helped us\\r\\ndown. But how were we to unfasten it, when arrived at the other end?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle employed a very simple expedient to obviate this difficulty.\\r\\nHe uncoiled a cord of the thickness of a finger, and four hundred\\r\\nfeet long; first he dropped half of it down, then he passed it round\\r\\na lava block that projected conveniently, and threw the other half\\r\\ndown the chimney. Each of us could then descend by holding with the\\r\\nhand both halves of the rope, which would not be able to unroll\\r\\nitself from its hold; when two hundred feet down, it would be easy to\\r\\nget possession of the whole of the rope by letting one end go and\\r\\npulling down by the other. Then the exercise would go on again _ad\\r\\ninfinitum_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said my uncle, after having completed these preparations, \"now\\r\\nlet us look to our loads. I will divide them into three lots; each of\\r\\nus will strap one upon his back. I mean only fragile articles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, we were not included under that head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hans,\" said he, \"will take charge of the tools and a portion of the\\r\\nprovisions; you, Axel, will take another third of the provisions, and\\r\\nthe arms; and I will take the rest of the provisions and the delicate\\r\\ninstruments.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" said I, \"the clothes, and that mass of ladders and ropes, what\\r\\nis to become of them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They will go down by themselves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How so?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will see presently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle was always willing to employ magnificent resources. Obeying\\r\\norders, Hans tied all the non-fragile articles in one bundle, corded\\r\\nthem firmly, and sent them bodily down the gulf before us.\\r\\n\\r\\nI listened to the dull thuds of the descending bale. My uncle,\\r\\nleaning over the abyss, followed the descent of the luggage with a\\r\\nsatisfied nod, and only rose erect when he had quite lost sight of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, now it is our turn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I ask any sensible man if it was possible to hear those words\\r\\nwithout a shudder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Professor fastened his package of instruments upon his shoulders;\\r\\nHans took the tools; I took the arms: and the descent commenced in\\r\\nthe following order; Hans, my uncle, and myself. It was effected in\\r\\nprofound silence, broken only by the descent of loosened stones down\\r\\nthe dark gulf.\\r\\n\\r\\nI dropped as it were, frantically clutching the double cord with one\\r\\nhand and buttressing myself from the wall with the other by means of\\r\\nmy stick. One idea overpowered me almost, fear lest the rock should\\r\\ngive way from which I was hanging. This cord seemed a fragile thing\\r\\nfor three persons to be suspended from. I made as little use of it as\\r\\npossible, performing wonderful feats of equilibrium upon the lava\\r\\nprojections which my foot seemed to catch hold of like a hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one of these slippery steps shook under the heavier form of\\r\\nHans, he said in his tranquil voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Gif akt!_\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Attention!\" repeated my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn half an hour we were standing upon the surface of a rock jammed in\\r\\nacross the chimney from one side to the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans pulled the rope by one of its ends, the other rose in the air;\\r\\nafter passing the higher rock it came down again, bringing with it a\\r\\nrather dangerous shower of bits of stone and lava.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaning over the edge of our narrow standing ground, I observed that\\r\\nthe bottom of the hole was still invisible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same manoeuvre was repeated with the cord, and half an hour after\\r\\nwe had descended another two hundred feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t suppose the maddest geologist under such circumstances would\\r\\nhave studied the nature of the rocks that we were passing. I am sure\\r\\nI did trouble my head about them. Pliocene, miocene, eocene,\\r\\ncretaceous, jurassic, triassic, permian, carboniferous, devonian,\\r\\nsilurian, or primitive was all one to me. But the Professor, no\\r\\ndoubt, was pursuing his observations or taking notes, for in one of\\r\\nour halts he said to me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The farther I go the more confidence I feel. The order of these\\r\\nvolcanic formations affords the strongest confirmation to the\\r\\ntheories of Davy. We are now among the primitive rocks, upon which\\r\\nthe chemical operations took place which are produced by the contact\\r\\nof elementary bases of metals with water. I repudiate the notion of\\r\\ncentral heat altogether. We shall see further proof of that very\\r\\nsoon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo variation, always the same conclusion. Of course, I was not\\r\\ninclined to argue. My silence was taken for consent and the descent\\r\\nwent on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother three hours, and I saw no bottom to the chimney yet. When I\\r\\nlifted my head I perceived the gradual contraction of its aperture.\\r\\nIts walls, by a gentle incline, were drawing closer to each other,\\r\\nand it was beginning to grow darker.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill we kept descending. It seemed to me that the falling stones\\r\\nwere meeting with an earlier resistance, and that the concussion gave\\r\\na more abrupt and deadened sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I had taken care to keep an exact account of our manoeuvres with\\r\\nthe rope, which I knew that we had repeated fourteen times, each\\r\\ndescent occupying half an hour, the conclusion was easy that we had\\r\\nbeen seven hours, plus fourteen quarters of rest, making ten hours\\r\\nand a half. We had started at one, it must therefore now be eleven\\r\\no\\'clock; and the depth to which we had descended was fourteen times\\r\\n200 feet, or 2,800 feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment I heard the voice of Hans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Halt!\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stopped short just as I was going to place my feet upon my uncle\\'s\\r\\nhead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are there,\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where?\" said I, stepping near to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the bottom of the perpendicular chimney,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is there no way farther?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; there is a sort of passage which inclines to the right. We will\\r\\nsee about that to-morrow. Let us have our supper, and go to sleep.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe darkness was not yet complete. The provision case was opened; we\\r\\nrefreshed ourselves, and went to sleep as well as we could upon a bed\\r\\nof stones and lava fragments.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen lying on my back, I opened my eyes and saw a bright sparkling\\r\\npoint of light at the extremity of the gigantic tube 3,000 feet long,\\r\\nnow a vast telescope.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a star which, seen from this depth, had lost all\\r\\nscintillation, and which by my computation should be  46; _Ursa\\r\\nminor._ Then I fell fast asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WONDERS OF TERRESTRIAL DEPTHS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt eight in the morning a ray of daylight came to wake us up. The\\r\\nthousand shining surfaces of lava on the walls received it on its\\r\\npassage, and scattered it like a shower of sparks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was light enough to distinguish surrounding objects.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Axel, what do you say to it?\" cried my uncle, rubbing his\\r\\nhands. \"Did you ever spend a quieter night in our little house at\\r\\nKoenigsberg? No noise of cart wheels, no cries of basket women, no\\r\\nboatmen shouting!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No doubt it is very quiet at the bottom of this well, but there is\\r\\nsomething alarming in the quietness itself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now come!\" my uncle cried; \"if you are frightened already, what will\\r\\nyou be by and by? We have not gone a single inch yet into the bowels\\r\\nof the earth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean that we have only reached the level of the island, long\\r\\nvertical tube, which terminates at the mouth of the crater, has its\\r\\nlower end only at the level of the sea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you sure of that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite sure. Consult the barometer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, the mercury, which had risen in the instrument as fast as we\\r\\ndescended, had stopped at twenty-nine inches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see,\" said the Professor, \"we have now only the pressure of our\\r\\natmosphere, and I shall be glad when the aneroid takes the place of\\r\\nthe barometer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in truth this instrument would become useless as soon as the\\r\\nweight of the atmosphere should exceed the pressure ascertained at\\r\\nthe level of the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" I said, \"is there not reason to fear that this ever-increasing\\r\\npressure will become at last very painful to bear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; we shall descend at a slow rate, and our lungs will become\\r\\ninured to a denser atmosphere. Aeronauts find the want of air as they\\r\\nrise to high elevations, but we shall perhaps have too much: of the\\r\\ntwo, this is what I should prefer. Don\\'t let us lose a moment. Where\\r\\nis the bundle we sent down before us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI then remembered that we had searched for it in vain the evening\\r\\nbefore. My uncle questioned Hans, who, after having examined\\r\\nattentively with the eye of a huntsman, replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Der huppe!_\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Up there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so it was. The bundle had been caught by a projection a hundred\\r\\nfeet above us. Immediately the Icelander climbed up like a cat, and\\r\\nin a few minutes the package was in our possession.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said my uncle, \"let us breakfast; but we must lay in a good\\r\\nstock, for we don\\'t know how long we may have to go on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biscuit and extract of meat were washed down with a draught of\\r\\nwater mingled with a little gin.\\r\\n\\r\\nBreakfast over, my uncle drew from his pocket a small notebook,\\r\\nintended for scientific observations. He consulted his instruments,\\r\\nand recorded:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Monday, July 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Chronometer, 8.17 a.m.; barometer, 297 in.; thermometer, 6 deg. (43 deg.\\r\\nF.). Direction, E.S.E.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis last observation applied to the dark gallery, and was indicated\\r\\nby the compass.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Axel,\" cried the Professor with enthusiasm, \"now we are really\\r\\ngoing into the interior of the earth. At this precise moment the\\r\\njourney commences.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying, my uncle took in one hand Ruhmkorff\\'s apparatus, which was\\r\\nhanging from his neck; and with the other he formed an electric\\r\\ncommunication with the coil in the lantern, and a sufficiently bright\\r\\nlight dispersed the darkness of the passage.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans carried the other apparatus, which was also put into action.\\r\\nThis ingenious application of electricity would enable us to go on\\r\\nfor a long time by creating an artificial light even in the midst of\\r\\nthe most inflammable gases.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, march!\" cried my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach shouldered his package. Hans drove before him the load of cords\\r\\nand clothes; and, myself walking last, we entered the gallery.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the moment of becoming engulfed in this dark gallery, I raised my\\r\\nhead, and saw for the last time through the length of that vast tube\\r\\nthe sky of Iceland, which I was never to behold again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lava, in the last eruption of 1229, had forced a passage through\\r\\nthis tunnel. It still lined the walls with a thick and glistening\\r\\ncoat. The electric light was here intensified a hundredfold by\\r\\nreflection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only difficulty in proceeding lay in not sliding too fast down an\\r\\nincline of about forty-five degrees; happily certain asperities and a\\r\\nfew blisterings here and there formed steps, and we descended,\\r\\nletting our baggage slip before us from the end of a long rope.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that which formed steps under our feet became stalactites\\r\\noverhead. The lava, which was porous in many places, had formed a\\r\\nsurface covered with small rounded blisters; crystals of opaque\\r\\nquartz, set with limpid tears of glass, and hanging like clustered\\r\\nchandeliers from the vaulted roof, seemed as it were to kindle and\\r\\nform a sudden illumination as we passed on our way. It seemed as if\\r\\nthe genii of the depths were lighting up their palace to receive\\r\\ntheir terrestrial guests.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is magnificent!\" I cried spontaneously. \"My uncle, what a sight!\\r\\nDon\\'t you admire those blending hues of lava, passing from reddish\\r\\nbrown to bright yellow by imperceptible shades? And these crystals\\r\\nare just like globes of light.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ali, you think so, do you, Axel, my boy? Well, you will see greater\\r\\nsplendours than these, I hope. Now let us march: march!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had better have said slide, for we did nothing but drop down the\\r\\nsteep inclines. It was the facifs _descensus Averni_ of Virgil. The\\r\\ncompass, which I consulted frequently, gave our direction as\\r\\nsouth-east with inflexible steadiness. This lava stream deviated\\r\\nneither to the right nor to the left.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet there was no sensible increase of temperature. This justified\\r\\nDavy\\'s theory, and more than once I consulted the thermometer with\\r\\nsurprise. Two hours after our departure it only marked 10 deg. (50 deg.\\r\\nFahr.), an increase of only 4 deg.. This gave reason for believing that\\r\\nour descent was more horizontal than vertical. As for the exact depth\\r\\nreached, it was very easy to ascertain that; the Professor measured\\r\\naccurately the angles of deviation and inclination on the road, but\\r\\nhe kept the results to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout eight in the evening he signalled to stop. Hans sat down at\\r\\nonce. The lamps were hung upon a projection in the lava; we were in a\\r\\nsort of cavern where there was plenty of air. Certain puffs of air\\r\\nreached us. What atmospheric disturbance was the cause of them? I\\r\\ncould not answer that question at the moment. Hunger and fatigue made\\r\\nme incapable of reasoning. A descent of seven hours consecutively is\\r\\nnot made without considerable expenditure of strength. I was\\r\\nexhausted. The order to \\'halt\\' therefore gave me pleasure. Hans laid\\r\\nour provisions upon a block of lava, and we ate with a good appetite.\\r\\nBut one thing troubled me, our supply of water was half consumed. My\\r\\nuncle reckoned upon a fresh supply from subterranean sources, but\\r\\nhitherto we had met with none. I could not help drawing his attention\\r\\nto this circumstance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you surprised at this want of springs?\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"More than that, I am anxious about it; we have only water enough for\\r\\nfive days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be uneasy, Axel, we shall find more than we want.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When we have left this bed of lava behind us. How could springs\\r\\nbreak through such walls as these?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But perhaps this passage runs to a very great depth. It seems to me\\r\\nthat we have made no great progress vertically.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why do you suppose that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because if we had gone deep into the crust of earth, we should have\\r\\nencountered greater heat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"According to your system,\" said my uncle. \"But what does the\\r\\nthermometer say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hardly fifteen degrees (59 deg. Fahr), nine degrees only since our\\r\\ndeparture.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what is your conclusion?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is my conclusion. According to exact observations, the increase\\r\\nof temperature in the interior of the globe advances at the rate of\\r\\none degree (1 4/5 deg. Fahr.) for every hundred feet. But certain local\\r\\nconditions may modify this rate. Thus at Yakoutsk in Siberia the\\r\\nincrease of a degree is ascertained to be reached every 36 feet. This\\r\\ndifference depends upon the heat-conducting power of the rocks.\\r\\nMoreover, in the neighbourhood of an extinct volcano, through gneiss,\\r\\nit has been observed that the increase of a degree is only attained\\r\\nat every 125 feet. Let us therefore assume this last hypothesis as\\r\\nthe most suitable to our situation, and calculate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, do calculate, my boy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing is easier,\" said I, putting down figures in my note book.\\r\\n\"Nine times a hundred and twenty-five feet gives a depth of eleven\\r\\nhundred and twenty-five feet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very accurate indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By my observation we are at 10,000 feet below the level of the sea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is that possible?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, or figures are of no use.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Professor\\'s calculations were quite correct. We had already\\r\\nattained a depth of six thousand feet beyond that hitherto reached by\\r\\nthe foot of man, such as the mines of Kitz Bahl in Tyrol, and those\\r\\nof Wuttembourg in Bohemia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe temperature, which ought to have been 81 deg. (178 deg. Fahr.) was\\r\\nscarcely 15 deg. (59 deg. Fahr.). Here was cause for reflection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nGEOLOGICAL STUDIES IN SITU\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day, Tuesday, June 30, at 6 a.m., the descent began again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were still following the gallery of lava, a real natural\\r\\nstaircase, and as gently sloping as those inclined planes which in\\r\\nsome old houses are still found instead of flights of steps. And so\\r\\nwe went on until 12.17, the, precise moment when we overtook Hans,\\r\\nwho had stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! here we are,\" exclaimed my uncle, \"at the very end of the\\r\\nchimney.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked around me. We were standing at the intersection of two\\r\\nroads, both dark and narrow. Which were we to take? This was a\\r\\ndifficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill my uncle refused to admit an appearance of hesitation, either\\r\\nbefore me or the guide; he pointed out the Eastern tunnel, and we\\r\\nwere soon all three in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides there would have been interminable hesitation before this\\r\\nchoice of roads; for since there was no indication whatever to guide\\r\\nour choice, we were obliged to trust to chance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe slope of this gallery was scarcely perceptible, and its sections\\r\\nvery unequal. Sometimes we passed a series of arches succeeding each\\r\\nother like the majestic arcades of a gothic cathedral. Here the\\r\\narchitects of the middle ages might have found studies for every form\\r\\nof the sacred art which sprang from the development of the pointed\\r\\narch. A mile farther we had to bow our heads under corniced elliptic\\r\\narches in the romanesque style; and massive pillars standing out from\\r\\nthe wall bent under the spring of the vault that rested heavily upon\\r\\nthem. In other places this magnificence gave way to narrow channels\\r\\nbetween low structures which looked like beaver\\'s huts, and we had to\\r\\ncreep along through extremely narrow passages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heat was perfectly bearable. Involuntarily I began to think of\\r\\nits heat when the lava thrown out by Snaefell was boiling and working\\r\\nthrough this now silent road. I imagined the torrents of fire hurled\\r\\nback at every angle in the gallery, and the accumulation of intensely\\r\\nheated vapours in the midst of this confined channel.\\r\\n\\r\\nI only hope, thought I, that this so-called extinct volcano won\\'t\\r\\ntake a fancy in his old age to begin his sports again!\\r\\n\\r\\nI abstained from communicating these fears to Professor Liedenbrock. He\\r\\nwould never have understood them at all. He had but one idea--forward!\\r\\nHe walked, he slid, he scrambled, he tumbled, with a persistency which\\r\\none could not but admire.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy six in the evening, after a not very fatiguing walk, we had gone\\r\\ntwo leagues south, but scarcely a quarter of a mile down.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle said it was time to go to sleep. We ate without talking, and\\r\\nwent to sleep without reflection.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur arrangements for the night were very simple; a railway rug each,\\r\\ninto which we rolled ourselves, was our sole covering. We had neither\\r\\ncold nor intrusive visits to fear. Travellers who penetrate into the\\r\\nwilds of central Africa, and into the pathless forests of the New\\r\\nWorld, are obliged to watch over each other by night. But we enjoyed\\r\\nabsolute safety and utter seclusion; no savages or wild beasts\\r\\ninfested these silent depths.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning, we awoke fresh and in good spirits. The road was\\r\\nresumed. As the day before, we followed the path of the lava. It was\\r\\nimpossible to tell what rocks we were passing: the tunnel, instead of\\r\\ntending lower, approached more and more nearly to a horizontal\\r\\ndirection, I even fancied a slight rise. But about ten this upward\\r\\ntendency became so evident, and therefore so fatiguing, that I was\\r\\nobliged to slacken my pace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Axel?\" demanded the Professor impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I cannot stand it any longer,\" I replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! after three hours\\' walk over such easy ground.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may be easy, but it is tiring all the same.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, when we have nothing to do but keep going down!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Going up, if you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Going up!\" said my uncle, with a shrug.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No doubt, for the last half-hour the inclines have gone the other\\r\\nway, and at this rate we shall soon arrive upon the level soil of\\r\\nIceland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Professor nodded slowly and uneasily like a man that declines to\\r\\nbe convinced. I tried to resume the conversation. He answered not a\\r\\nword, and gave the signal for a start. I saw that his silence was\\r\\nnothing but ill-humour.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill I had courageously shouldered my burden again, and was rapidly\\r\\nfollowing Hans, whom my uncle preceded. I was anxious not to be left\\r\\nbehind. My greatest care was not to lose sight of my companions. I\\r\\nshuddered at the thought of being lost in the mazes of this vast\\r\\nsubterranean labyrinth.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides, if the ascending road did become steeper, I was comforted\\r\\nwith the thought that it was bringing us nearer to the surface. There\\r\\nwas hope in this. Every step confirmed me in it, and I was rejoicing\\r\\nat the thought of meeting my little Graeuben again.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy mid-day there was a change in the appearance of this wall of the\\r\\ngallery. I noticed it by a diminution of the amount of light\\r\\nreflected from the sides; solid rock was appearing in the place of\\r\\nthe lava coating. The mass was composed of inclined and sometimes\\r\\nvertical strata. We were passing through rocks of the transition or\\r\\nsilurian [1] system.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is evident,\" I cried, \"the marine deposits formed in the second\\r\\nperiod, these shales, limestones, and sandstones. We are turning away\\r\\nfrom the primary granite. We are just as if we were people of Hamburg\\r\\ngoing to Luebeck by way of Hanover!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had better have kept my observations to myself. But my geological\\r\\ninstinct was stronger than my prudence, and uncle Liedenbrock heard\\r\\nmy exclamation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s that you are saying?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See,\" I said, pointing to the varied series of sandstones and\\r\\nlimestones, and the first indication of slate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are at the period when the first plants and animals appeared.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look close, and examine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI obliged the Professor to move his lamp over the walls of the\\r\\ngallery. I expected some signs of astonishment; but he spoke not a\\r\\nword, and went on.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad he understood me or not? Did he refuse to admit, out of self-love\\r\\nas an uncle and a philosopher, that he had mistaken his way when he\\r\\nchose the eastern tunnel? or was he determined to examine this\\r\\npassage to its farthest extremity? It was evident that we had left\\r\\nthe lava path, and that this road could not possibly lead to the\\r\\nextinct furnace of Snaefell.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet I asked myself if I was not depending too much on this change in\\r\\nthe rock. Might I not myself be mistaken? Were we really crossing the\\r\\nlayers of rock which overlie the granite foundation?\\r\\n\\r\\n[1]The name given by Sir Roderick Murchison to a vast series of\\r\\nfossiliferous strata, which lies between the non-fossiliferous slaty\\r\\nschists below and the old red sandstone above. The system is well\\r\\ndeveloped in the region of Shropshire, etc., once inhabited by the\\r\\nSilures under Caractacus, or Caradoc. (Tr.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I am right, I thought, I must soon find some fossil remains of\\r\\nprimitive life; and then we must yield to evidence. I will look.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had not gone a hundred paces before incontestable proofs presented\\r\\nthemselves. It could not be otherwise, for in the Silurian age the\\r\\nseas contained at least fifteen hundred vegetable and animal species.\\r\\nMy feet, which had become accustomed to the indurated lava floor,\\r\\nsuddenly rested upon a dust composed of the _debris_ of plants and\\r\\nshells. In the walls were distinct impressions of fucoids and\\r\\nlycopodites.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Liedenbrock could not be mistaken, I thought, and yet he\\r\\npushed on, with, I suppose, his eyes resolutely shut.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was only invincible obstinacy. I could hold out no longer. I\\r\\npicked up a perfectly formed shell, which had belonged to an animal\\r\\nnot unlike the woodlouse: then, joining my uncle, I said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look at this!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well,\" said he quietly, \"it is the shell of a crustacean, of an\\r\\nextinct species called a trilobite. Nothing more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But don\\'t you conclude--?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just what you conclude yourself. Yes; I do, perfectly. We have left\\r\\nthe granite and the lava. It is possible that I may be mistaken. But\\r\\nI cannot be sure of that until I have reached the very end of this\\r\\ngallery.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are right in doing this, my uncle, and I should quite approve of\\r\\nyour determination, if there were not a danger threatening us nearer\\r\\nand nearer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What danger?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The want of water.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Axel, we will put ourselves upon rations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XX.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FIRST SIGNS OF DISTRESS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, we had to ration ourselves. Our provision of water could not\\r\\nlast more than three days. I found that out for certain when\\r\\nsupper-time came. And, to our sorrow, we had little reason to expect\\r\\nto find a spring in these transition beds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole of the next day the gallery opened before us its endless\\r\\narcades. We moved on almost without a word. Hans\\' silence seemed to\\r\\nbe infecting us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road was now not ascending, at least not perceptibly. Sometimes,\\r\\neven, it seemed to have a slight fall. But this tendency, which was\\r\\nvery trifling, could not do anything to reassure the Professor; for\\r\\nthere was no change in the beds, and the transitional characteristics\\r\\nbecame more and more decided.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe electric light was reflected in sparkling splendour from the\\r\\nschist, limestone, and old red sandstone of the walls. It might have\\r\\nbeen thought that we were passing through a section of Wales, of\\r\\nwhich an ancient people gave its name to this system. Specimens of\\r\\nmagnificent marbles clothed the walls, some of a greyish agate\\r\\nfantastically veined with white, others of rich crimson or yellow\\r\\ndashed with splotches of red; then came dark cherry-coloured marbles\\r\\nrelieved by the lighter tints of limestone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe greater part of these bore impressions of primitive organisms.\\r\\nCreation had evidently advanced since the day before. Instead of\\r\\nrudimentary trilobites, I noticed remains of a more perfect order of\\r\\nbeings, amongst others ganoid fishes and some of those sauroids in\\r\\nwhich palaeontologists have discovered the earliest reptile forms.\\r\\nThe Devonian seas were peopled by animals of these species, and\\r\\ndeposited them by thousands in the rocks of the newer formation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was evident that we were ascending that scale of animal life in\\r\\nwhich man fills the highest place. But Professor Liedenbrock seemed\\r\\nnot to notice it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was awaiting one of two events, either the appearance of a\\r\\nvertical well opening before his feet, down which our descent might\\r\\nbe resumed, or that of some obstacle which should effectually turn us\\r\\nback on our own footsteps. But evening came and neither wish was\\r\\ngratified.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Friday, after a night during which I felt pangs of thirst, our\\r\\nlittle troop again plunged into the winding passages of the gallery.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter ten hours\\' walking I observed a singular deadening of the\\r\\nreflection of our lamps from the side walls. The marble, the schist,\\r\\nthe limestone, and the sandstone were giving way to a dark and\\r\\nlustreless lining. At one moment, the tunnel becoming very narrow, I\\r\\nleaned against the wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I removed my hand it was black. I looked nearer, and found we\\r\\nwere in a coal formation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A coal mine!\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A mine without miners,\" my uncle replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who knows?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know,\" the Professor pronounced decidedly, \"I am certain that this\\r\\ngallery driven through beds of coal was never pierced by the hand of\\r\\nman. But whether it be the hand of nature or not does not matter.\\r\\nSupper time is come; let us sup.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHans prepared some food. I scarcely ate, and I swallowed down the few\\r\\ndrops of water rationed out to me. One flask half full was all we had\\r\\nleft to slake the thirst of three men.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter their meal my two companions laid themselves down upon their\\r\\nrugs, and found in sleep a solace for their fatigue. But I could not\\r\\nsleep, and I counted every hour until morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday, at six, we started afresh. In twenty minutes we reached\\r\\na vast open space; I then knew that the hand of man had not hollowed\\r\\nout this mine; the vaults would have been shored up, and, as it was,\\r\\nthey seemed to be held up by a miracle of equilibrium.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis cavern was about a hundred feet wide and a hundred and fifty in\\r\\nheight. A large mass had been rent asunder by a subterranean\\r\\ndisturbance. Yielding to some vast power from below it had broken\\r\\nasunder, leaving this great hollow into which human beings were now\\r\\npenetrating for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole history of the carboniferous period was written upon these\\r\\ngloomy walls, and a geologist might with ease trace all its diverse\\r\\nphases. The beds of coal were separated by strata of sandstone or\\r\\ncompact clays, and appeared crushed under the weight of overlying\\r\\nstrata.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the age of the world which preceded the secondary period, the\\r\\nearth was clothed with immense vegetable forms, the product of the\\r\\ndouble influence of tropical heat and constant moisture; a vapoury\\r\\natmosphere surrounded the earth, still veiling the direct rays of the\\r\\nsun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThence arises the conclusion that the high temperature then existing\\r\\nwas due to some other source than the heat of the sun. Perhaps even\\r\\nthe orb of day may not have been ready yet to play the splendid part\\r\\nhe now acts. There were no \\'climates\\' as yet, and a torrid heat,\\r\\nequal from pole to equator, was spread over the whole surface of the\\r\\nglobe. Whence this heat? Was it from the interior of the earth?\\r\\n\\r\\nNotwithstanding the theories of Professor Liedenbrock, a violent heat\\r\\ndid at that time brood within the body of the spheroid. Its action\\r\\nwas felt to the very last coats of the terrestrial crust; the plants,\\r\\nunacquainted with the beneficent influences of the sun, yielded\\r\\nneither flowers nor scent. But their roots drew vigorous life from\\r\\nthe burning soil of the early days of this planet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were but few trees. Herbaceous plants alone existed. There were\\r\\ntall grasses, ferns, lycopods, besides sigillaria, asterophyllites,\\r\\nnow scarce plants, but then the species might be counted by thousands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coal measures owe their origin to this period of profuse\\r\\nvegetation. The yet elastic and yielding crust of the earth obeyed\\r\\nthe fluid forces beneath. Thence innumerable fissures and\\r\\ndepressions. The plants, sunk underneath the waters, formed by\\r\\ndegrees into vast accumulated masses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen came the chemical action of nature; in the depths of the seas\\r\\nthe vegetable accumulations first became peat; then, acted upon by\\r\\ngenerated gases and the heat of fermentation, they underwent a\\r\\nprocess of complete mineralization.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus were formed those immense coalfields, which nevertheless, are\\r\\nnot inexhaustible, and which three centuries at the present\\r\\naccelerated rate of consumption will exhaust unless the industrial\\r\\nworld will devise a remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese reflections came into my mind whilst I was contemplating the\\r\\nmineral wealth stored up in this portion of the globe. These no\\r\\ndoubt, I thought, will never be discovered; the working of such deep\\r\\nmines would involve too large an outlay, and where would be the use\\r\\nas long as coal is yet spread far and wide near the surface? Such as\\r\\nmy eyes behold these virgin stores, such they will be when this world\\r\\ncomes to an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut still we marched on, and I alone was forgetting the length of the\\r\\nway by losing myself in the midst of geological contemplations. The\\r\\ntemperature remained what it had been during our passage through the\\r\\nlava and schists. Only my sense of smell was forcibly affected by an\\r\\nodour of protocarburet of hydrogen. I immediately recognised in this\\r\\ngallery the presence of a considerable quantity of the dangerous gas\\r\\ncalled by miners firedamp, the explosion of which has often\\r\\noccasioned such dreadful catastrophes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHappily, our light was from Ruhmkorff\\'s ingenious apparatus. If\\r\\nunfortunately we had explored this gallery with torches, a terrible\\r\\nexplosion would have put an end to travelling and travellers at one\\r\\nstroke.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis excursion through the coal mine lasted till night. My uncle\\r\\nscarcely could restrain his impatience at the horizontal road. The\\r\\ndarkness, always deep twenty yards before us, prevented us from\\r\\nestimating the length of the gallery; and I was beginning to think it\\r\\nmust be endless, when suddenly at six o\\'clock a wall very\\r\\nunexpectedly stood before us. Right or left, top or bottom, there was\\r\\nno road farther; we were at the end of a blind alley. \"Very well,\\r\\nit\\'s all right!\" cried my uncle, \"now, at any rate, we shall know\\r\\nwhat we are about. We are not in Saknussemm\\'s road, and all we have\\r\\nto do is to go back. Let us take a night\\'s rest, and in three days we\\r\\nshall get to the fork in the road.\" \"Yes,\" said I, \"if we have any\\r\\nstrength left.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because to-morrow we shall have no\\r\\nwater.\" \"Nor courage either?\" asked my uncle severely. I dared make\\r\\nno answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXI.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOMPASSION FUSES THE PROFESSOR\\'S HEART\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day we started early. We had to hasten forward. It was a three\\r\\ndays\\' march to the cross roads.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will not speak of the sufferings we endured in our return. My uncle\\r\\nbore them with the angry impatience of a man obliged to own his\\r\\nweakness; Hans with the resignation of his passive nature; I, I\\r\\nconfess, with complaints and expressions of despair. I had no spirit\\r\\nto oppose this ill fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I had foretold, the water failed entirely by the end of the first\\r\\nday\\'s retrograde march. Our fluid aliment was now nothing but gin;\\r\\nbut this infernal fluid burned my throat, and I could not even endure\\r\\nthe sight of it. I found the temperature and the air stifling.\\r\\nFatigue paralysed my limbs. More than once I dropped down motionless.\\r\\nThen there was a halt; and my uncle and the Icelander did their best\\r\\nto restore me. But I saw that the former was struggling painfully\\r\\nagainst excessive fatigue and the tortures of thirst.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, on Tuesday, July 8, we arrived on our hands and knees, and\\r\\nhalf dead, at the junction of the two roads. There I dropped like a\\r\\nlifeless lump, extended on the lava soil. It was ten in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans and my uncle, clinging to the wall, tried to nibble a few bits\\r\\nof biscuit. Long moans escaped from my swollen lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some time my uncle approached me and raised me in his arms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor boy!\" said he, in genuine tones of compassion.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was touched with these words, not being accustomed to see the\\r\\nexcitable Professor in a softened mood. I grasped his trembling hands\\r\\nin mine. He let me hold them and looked at me. His eyes were\\r\\nmoistened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I saw him take the flask that was hanging at his side. To my\\r\\namazement he placed it on my lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Drink!\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad I heard him? Was my uncle beside himself? I stared at, him\\r\\nstupidly, and felt as if I could not understand him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Drink!\" he said again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd raising his flask he emptied it every drop between my lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! infinite pleasure! a slender sip of water came to moisten my\\r\\nburning mouth. It was but one sip but it was enough to recall my\\r\\nebbing life.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thanked my uncle with clasped hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"a draught of water; but it is the very last--you\\r\\nhear!--the last. I had kept it as a precious treasure at the bottom\\r\\nof my flask. Twenty times, nay, a hundred times, have I fought\\r\\nagainst a frightful impulse to drink it off. But no, Axel, I kept it\\r\\nfor you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear uncle,\" I said, whilst hot tears trickled down my face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, my poor boy, I knew that as soon as you arrived at these cross\\r\\nroads you would drop half dead, and I kept my last drop of water to\\r\\nreanimate you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, thank you,\" I said. Although my thirst was only partially\\r\\nquenched, yet some strength had returned. The muscles of my throat,\\r\\nuntil then contracted, now relaxed again; and the inflammation of my\\r\\nlips abated somewhat; and I was now able to speak. .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us see,\" I said, \"we have now but one thing to do. We have no\\r\\nwater; we must go back.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I spoke my uncle avoided looking at me; he hung his head down;\\r\\nhis eyes avoided mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must return,\" I exclaimed vehemently; \"we must go back on our way\\r\\nto Snaefell. May God give us strength to climb up the crater again!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Return!\" said my uncle, as if he was rather answering himself than\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, return, without the loss of a minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA long silence followed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So then, Axel,\" replied the Professor ironically, \"you have found no\\r\\ncourage or energy in these few drops of water?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Courage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see you just as feeble-minded as you were before, and still\\r\\nexpressing only despair!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat sort of a man was this I had to do with, and what schemes was he\\r\\nnow revolving in his fearless mind?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! you won\\'t go back?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Should I renounce this expedition just when we have the fairest\\r\\nchance of success! Never!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then must we resign ourselves to destruction?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Axel, no; go back. Hans will go with you. Leave me to myself!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Leave you here!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Leave me, I tell you. I have undertaken this expedition. I will\\r\\ncarry it out to the end, and I will not return. Go, Axel, go!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle was in high state of excitement. His voice, which had for a\\r\\nmoment been tender and gentle, had now become hard and threatening.\\r\\nHe was struggling with gloomy resolutions against impossibilities. I\\r\\nwould not leave him in this bottomless abyss, and on the other hand\\r\\nthe instinct of self-preservation prompted me to fly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guide watched this scene with his usual phlegmatic unconcern. Yet\\r\\nhe understood perfectly well what was going on between his two\\r\\ncompanions. The gestures themselves were sufficient to show that we\\r\\nwere each bent on taking a different road; but Hans seemed to take no\\r\\npart in a question upon which depended his life. He was ready to\\r\\nstart at a given signal, or to stay, if his master so willed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow I wished at this moment I could have made him understand me. My\\r\\nwords, my complaints, my sorrow would have had some influence over\\r\\nthat frigid nature. Those dangers which our guide could not\\r\\nunderstand I could have demonstrated and proved to him. Together we\\r\\nmight have over-ruled the obstinate Professor; if it were needed, we\\r\\nmight perhaps have compelled him to regain the heights of Snaefell.\\r\\n\\r\\nI drew near to Hans. I placed my hand upon his. He made no movement.\\r\\nMy parted lips sufficiently revealed my sufferings. The Icelander\\r\\nslowly moved his head, and calmly pointing to my uncle said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Master.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Master!\" I shouted; \"you madman! no, he is not the master of our\\r\\nlife; we must fly, we must drag him. Do you hear me? Do you\\r\\nunderstand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had seized Hans by the arm. I wished to oblige him to rise. I\\r\\nstrove with him. My uncle interposed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be calm, Axel! you will get nothing from that immovable servant.\\r\\nTherefore, listen to my proposal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI crossed my arms, and confronted my uncle boldly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The want of water,\" he said, \"is the only obstacle in our way. In\\r\\nthis eastern gallery made up of lavas, schists, and coal, we have not\\r\\nmet with a single particle of moisture. Perhaps we shall be more\\r\\nfortunate if we follow the western tunnel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI shook my head incredulously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hear me to the end,\" the Professor went on with a firm voice.\\r\\n\"Whilst you were lying there motionless, I went to examine the\\r\\nconformation of that gallery. It penetrates directly downward, and in\\r\\na few hours it will bring us to the granite rocks. There we must meet\\r\\nwith abundant springs. The nature of the rock assures me of this, and\\r\\ninstinct agrees with logic to support my conviction. Now, this is my\\r\\nproposal. When Columbus asked of his ships\\' crews for three days more\\r\\nto discover a new world, those crews, disheartened and sick as they\\r\\nwere, recognised the justice of the claim, and he discovered America.\\r\\nI am the Columbus of this nether world, and I only ask for one more\\r\\nday. If in a single day I have not met with the water that we want, I\\r\\nswear to you we will return to the surface of the earth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of my irritation I was moved with these words, as well as\\r\\nwith the violence my uncle was doing to his own wishes in making so\\r\\nhazardous a proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" I said, \"do as you will, and God reward your superhuman\\r\\nenergy. You have now but a few hours to tempt fortune. Let us start!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXII.\\r\\n\\r\\nTOTAL FAILURE OF WATER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time the descent commenced by the new gallery. Hans walked first\\r\\nas was his custom.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had not gone a hundred yards when the Professor, moving his\\r\\nlantern along the walls, cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here are primitive rocks. Now we are in the right way. Forward!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen in its early stages the earth was slowly cooling, its\\r\\ncontraction gave rise in its crust to disruptions, distortions,\\r\\nfissures, and chasms. The passage through which we were moving was\\r\\nsuch a fissure, through which at one time granite poured out in a\\r\\nmolten state. Its thousands of windings formed an inextricable\\r\\nlabyrinth through the primeval mass.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs fast as we descended, the succession of beds forming the primitive\\r\\nfoundation came out with increasing distinctness. Geologists consider\\r\\nthis primitive matter to be the base of the mineral crust of the\\r\\nearth, and have ascertained it to be composed of three different\\r\\nformations, schist, gneiss, and mica schist, resting upon that\\r\\nunchangeable foundation, the granite.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever had mineralogists found themselves in so marvellous a situation\\r\\nto study nature in situ. What the boring machine, an insensible,\\r\\ninert instrument, was unable to bring to the surface of the inner\\r\\nstructure of the globe, we were able to peruse with our own eyes and\\r\\nhandle with our own hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the beds of schist, coloured with delicate shades of green,\\r\\nran in winding course threads of copper and manganese, with traces of\\r\\nplatinum and gold. I thought, what riches are here buried at an\\r\\nunapproachable depth in the earth, hidden for ever from the covetous\\r\\neyes of the human race! These treasures have been buried at such a\\r\\nprofound depth by the convulsions of primeval times that they run no\\r\\nchance of ever being molested by the pickaxe or the spade.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the schists succeeded gneiss, partially stratified, remarkable for\\r\\nthe parallelism and regularity of its lamina, then mica schists, laid\\r\\nin large plates or flakes, revealing their lamellated structure by\\r\\nthe sparkle of the white shining mica.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe light from our apparatus, reflected from the small facets of\\r\\nquartz, shot sparkling rays at every angle, and I seemed to be moving\\r\\nthrough a diamond, within which the quickly darting rays broke across\\r\\neach other in a thousand flashing coruscations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout six o\\'clock this brilliant fete of illuminations underwent a\\r\\nsensible abatement of splendour, then almost ceased. The walls\\r\\nassumed a crystallised though sombre appearance; mica was more\\r\\nclosely mingled with the feldspar and quartz to form the proper rocky\\r\\nfoundations of the earth, which bears without distortion or crushing\\r\\nthe weight of the four terrestrial systems. We were immured within\\r\\nprison walls of granite.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was eight in the evening. No signs of water had yet appeared. I\\r\\nwas suffering horribly. My uncle strode on. He refused to stop. He\\r\\nwas listening anxiously for the murmur of distant springs. But, no,\\r\\nthere was dead silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now my limbs were failing beneath me. I resisted pain and\\r\\ntorture, that I might not stop my uncle, which would have driven him\\r\\nto despair, for the day was drawing near to its end, and it was his\\r\\nlast.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last I failed utterly; I uttered a cry and fell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come to me, I am dying.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle retraced his steps. He gazed upon me with his arms crossed;\\r\\nthen these muttered words passed his lips:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s all over!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last thing I saw was a fearful gesture of rage, and my eyes\\r\\nclosed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I reopened them I saw my two companions motionless and rolled up\\r\\nin their coverings. Were they asleep? As for me, I could not get one\\r\\nmoment\\'s sleep. I was suffering too keenly, and what embittered my\\r\\nthoughts was that there was no remedy. My uncle\\'s last words echoed\\r\\npainfully in my ears: \"it\\'s all over!\" For in such a fearful state of\\r\\ndebility it was madness to think of ever reaching the upper world\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had above us a league and a half of terrestrial crust. The weight\\r\\nof it seemed to be crushing down upon my shoulders. I felt weighed\\r\\ndown, and I exhausted myself with imaginary violent exertions to turn\\r\\nround upon my granite couch.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few hours passed away. A deep silence reigned around us, the\\r\\nsilence of the grave. No sound could reach us through walls, the\\r\\nthinnest of which were five miles thick.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet in the midst of my stupefaction I seemed to be aware of a noise.\\r\\nIt was dark down the tunnel, but I seemed to see the Icelander\\r\\nvanishing from our sight with the lamp in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy was he leaving us? Was Hans going to forsake us? My uncle was\\r\\nfast asleep. I wanted to shout, but my voice died upon my parched and\\r\\nswollen lips. The darkness became deeper, and the last sound died\\r\\naway in the far distance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hans has abandoned us,\" I cried. \"Hans! Hans!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut these words were only spoken within me. They went no farther. Yet\\r\\nafter the first moment of terror I felt ashamed of suspecting a man\\r\\nof such extraordinary faithfulness. Instead of ascending he was\\r\\ndescending the gallery. An evil design would have taken him up not\\r\\ndown. This reflection restored me to calmness, and I turned to other\\r\\nthoughts. None but some weighty motive could have induced so quiet a\\r\\nman to forfeit his sleep. Was he on a journey of discovery? Had he\\r\\nduring the silence of the night caught a sound, a murmuring of\\r\\nsomething in the distance, which had failed to affect my hearing?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nWATER DISCOVERED\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a whole hour I was trying to work out in my delirious brain the\\r\\nreasons which might have influenced this seemingly tranquil huntsman.\\r\\nThe absurdest notions ran in utter confusion through my mind. I\\r\\nthought madness was coming on!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at last a noise of footsteps was heard in the dark abyss. Hans\\r\\nwas approaching. A flickering light was beginning to glimmer on the\\r\\nwall of our darksome prison; then it came out full at the mouth of\\r\\nthe gallery. Hans appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe drew close to my uncle, laid his hand upon his shoulder, and\\r\\ngently woke him. My uncle rose up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Watten!_\" replied the huntsman.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo doubt under the inspiration of intense pain everybody becomes\\r\\nendowed with the gift of divers tongues. I did not know a word of\\r\\nDanish, yet instinctively I understood the word he had uttered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Water! water!\" I cried, clapping my hands and gesticulating like a\\r\\nmadman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Water!\" repeated my uncle. \"Hvar?\" he asked, in Icelandic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Nedat,_\" replied Hans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where? Down below!\" I understood it all. I seized the hunter\\'s\\r\\nhands, and pressed them while he looked on me without moving a muscle\\r\\nof his countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe preparations for our departure were not long in making, and we\\r\\nwere soon on our way down a passage inclining two feet in seven. In\\r\\nan hour we had gone a mile and a quarter, and descended two thousand\\r\\nfeet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I began to hear distinctly quite a new sound of something\\r\\nrunning within the thickness of the granite wall, a kind of dull,\\r\\ndead rumbling, like distant thunder. During the first part of our\\r\\nwalk, not meeting with the promised spring, I felt my agony\\r\\nreturning; but then my uncle acquainted me with the cause of the\\r\\nstrange noise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hans was not mistaken,\" he said. \"What you hear is the rushing of a\\r\\ntorrent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A torrent?\" I exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There can be no doubt; a subterranean river is flowing around us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hurried forward in the greatest excitement. I was no longer\\r\\nsensible of my fatigue. This murmuring of waters close at hand was\\r\\nalready refreshing me. It was audibly increasing. The torrent, after\\r\\nhaving for some time flowed over our heads, was now running within\\r\\nthe left wall, roaring and rushing. Frequently I touched the wall,\\r\\nhoping to feel some indications of moisture: But there was no hope\\r\\nhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet another half hour, another half league was passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen it became clear that the hunter had gone no farther. Guided by\\r\\nan instinct peculiar to mountaineers he had as it were felt this\\r\\ntorrent through the rock; but he had certainly seen none of the\\r\\nprecious liquid; he had drunk nothing himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon it became evident that if we continued our walk we should widen\\r\\nthe distance between ourselves and the stream, the noise of which was\\r\\nbecoming fainter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe returned. Hans stopped where the torrent seemed closest. I sat\\r\\nnear the wall, while the waters were flowing past me at a distance of\\r\\ntwo feet with extreme violence. But there was a thick granite wall\\r\\nbetween us and the object of our desires.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout reflection, without asking if there were any means of\\r\\nprocuring the water, I gave way to a movement of despair.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans glanced at me with, I thought, a smile of compassion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose and took the lamp. I followed him. He moved towards the wall.\\r\\nI looked on. He applied his ear against the dry stone, and moved it\\r\\nslowly to and fro, listening intently. I perceived at once that he\\r\\nwas examining to find the exact place where the torrent could be\\r\\nheard the loudest. He met with that point on the left side of the\\r\\ntunnel, at three feet from the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was stirred up with excitement. I hardly dared guess what the\\r\\nhunter was about to do. But I could not but understand, and applaud\\r\\nand cheer him on, when I saw him lay hold of the pickaxe to make an\\r\\nattack upon the rock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are saved!\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" cried my uncle, almost frantic with excitement. \"Hans is\\r\\nright. Capital fellow! Who but he would have thought of it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYes; who but he? Such an expedient, however simple, would never have\\r\\nentered into our minds. True, it seemed most hazardous to strike a\\r\\nblow of the hammer in this part of the earth\\'s structure. Suppose\\r\\nsome displacement should occur and crush us all! Suppose the torrent,\\r\\nbursting through, should drown us in a sudden flood! There was\\r\\nnothing vain in these fancies. But still no fears of falling rocks or\\r\\nrushing floods could stay us now; and our thirst was so intense that,\\r\\nto satisfy it, we would have dared the waves of the north Atlantic.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans set about the task which my uncle and I together could not have\\r\\naccomplished. If our impatience had armed our hands with power, we\\r\\nshould have shattered the rock into a thousand fragments. Not so\\r\\nHans. Full of self possession, he calmly wore his way through the\\r\\nrock with a steady succession of light and skilful strokes, working\\r\\nthrough an aperture six inches wide at the outside. I could hear a\\r\\nlouder noise of flowing waters, and I fancied I could feel the\\r\\ndelicious fluid refreshing my parched lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pick had soon penetrated two feet into the granite partition, and\\r\\nour man had worked for above an hour. I was in an agony of\\r\\nimpatience. My uncle wanted to employ stronger measures, and I had\\r\\nsome difficulty in dissuading him; still he had just taken a pickaxe\\r\\nin his hand, when a sudden hissing was heard, and a jet of water\\r\\nspurted out with violence against the opposite wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans, almost thrown off his feet by the violence of the shock,\\r\\nuttered a cry of grief and disappointment, of which I soon under-.\\r\\nstood the cause, when plunging my hands into the spouting torrent, I\\r\\nwithdrew them in haste, for the water was scalding hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The water is at the boiling point,\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, never mind, let it cool,\" my uncle replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tunnel was filling with steam, whilst a stream was forming, which\\r\\nby degrees wandered away into subterranean windings, and soon we had\\r\\nthe satisfaction of swallowing our first draught.\\r\\n\\r\\nCould anything be more delicious than the sensation that our burning\\r\\nintolerable thirst was passing away, and leaving us to enjoy comfort\\r\\nand pleasure? But where was this water from? No matter. It was water;\\r\\nand though still warm, it brought life back to the dying. I kept\\r\\ndrinking without stopping, and almost without tasting.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last after a most delightful time of reviving energy, I cried,\\r\\n\"Why, this is a chalybeate spring!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing could be better for the digestion,\" said my uncle. \"It is\\r\\nhighly impregnated with iron. It will be as good for us as going to\\r\\nthe Spa, or to Toeplitz.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it is delicious!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course it is, water should be, found six miles underground. It\\r\\nhas an inky flavour, which is not at all unpleasant. What a capital\\r\\nsource of strength Hans has found for us here. We will call it after\\r\\nhis name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Agreed,\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Hansbach it was from that moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans was none the prouder. After a moderate draught, he went quietly\\r\\ninto a corner to rest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" I said, \"we must not lose this water.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the use of troubling ourselves?\" my uncle, replied. \"I fancy\\r\\nit will never fail.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind, we cannot be sure; let us fill the water bottle and our\\r\\nflasks, and then stop up the opening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy advice was followed so far as getting in a supply; but the\\r\\nstopping up of the hole was not so easy to accomplish. It was in vain\\r\\nthat we took up fragments of granite, and stuffed them in with tow,\\r\\nwe only scalded our hands without succeeding. The pressure was too\\r\\ngreat, and our efforts were fruitless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is quite plain,\" said I, \"that the higher body of this water is\\r\\nat a considerable elevation. The force of the jet shows that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No doubt,\" answered my uncle. \"If this column of water is 32,000\\r\\nfeet high--that is, from the surface of the earth, it is equal to\\r\\nthe weight of a thousand atmospheres. But I have got an idea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should we trouble ourselves to stop the stream from coming out\\r\\nat all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because--\" Well, I could not assign a reason.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When our flasks are empty, where shall we fill them again? Can we\\r\\ntell that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo; there was no certainty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, let us allow the water to run on. It will flow down, and will\\r\\nboth guide and refresh us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is well planned,\" I cried. \"With this stream for our guide,\\r\\nthere is no reason why we should not succeed in our undertaking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, my boy! you agree with me now,\" cried the Professor, laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I agree with you most heartily.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, let us rest awhile; and then we will start again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was forgetting that it was night. The chronometer soon informed me\\r\\nof that fact; and in a very short time, refreshed and thankful, we\\r\\nall three fell into a sound sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nWELL SAID, OLD MOLE! CANST THOU WORK I\\' THE GROUND SO FAST?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the next day we had forgotten all our sufferings. At first, I was\\r\\nwondering that I was no longer thirsty, and I was for asking for the\\r\\nreason. The answer came in the murmuring of the stream at my feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe breakfasted, and drank of this excellent chalybeate water. I felt\\r\\nwonderfully stronger, and quite decided upon pushing on. Why should\\r\\nnot so firmly convinced a man as my uncle, furnished with so\\r\\nindustrious a guide as Hans, and accompanied by so determined a\\r\\nnephew as myself, go on to final success? Such were the magnificent\\r\\nplans which struggled for mastery within me. If it had been proposed\\r\\nto me to return to the summit of Snaefell, I should have indignantly\\r\\ndeclined.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost fortunately, all we had to do was to descend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us start!\" I cried, awakening by my shouts the echoes of the\\r\\nvaulted hollows of the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Thursday, at 8 a.m., we started afresh. The granite tunnel winding\\r\\nfrom side to side, earned us past unexpected turns, and seemed almost\\r\\nto form a labyrinth; but, on the whole, its direction seemed to be\\r\\nsouth-easterly. My uncle never ceased to consult his compass, to keep\\r\\naccount of the ground gone over.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gallery dipped down a very little way from the horizontal,\\r\\nscarcely more than two inches in a fathom, and the stream ran gently\\r\\nmurmuring at our feet. I compared it to a friendly genius guiding us\\r\\nunderground, and caressed with my hand the soft naiad, whose\\r\\ncomforting voice accompanied our steps. With my reviving spirits\\r\\nthese mythological notions seemed to come unbidden.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for my uncle, he was beginning to storm against the horizontal\\r\\nroad. He loved nothing better than a vertical path; but this way\\r\\nseemed indefinitely prolonged, and instead of sliding along the\\r\\nhypothenuse as we were now doing, he would willingly have dropped\\r\\ndown the terrestrial radius. But there was no help for it, and as\\r\\nlong as we were approaching the centre at all we felt that we must\\r\\nnot complain.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom time to time, a steeper path appeared; our naiad then began to\\r\\ntumble before us with a hoarser murmur, and we went down with her to\\r\\na greater depth.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the whole, that day and the next we made considerable way\\r\\nhorizontally, very little vertically.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Friday evening, the 10th of July, according to our calculations,\\r\\nwe were thirty leagues south-east of Rejkiavik, and at a depth of two\\r\\nleagues and a half.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt our feet there now opened a frightful abyss. My uncle, however,\\r\\nwas not to be daunted, and he clapped his hands at the steepness of\\r\\nthe descent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This will take us a long way,\" he cried, \"and without much\\r\\ndifficulty; for the projections in the rock form quite a staircase.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ropes were so fastened by Hans as to guard against accident, and\\r\\nthe descent commenced. I can hardly call it perilous, for I was\\r\\nbeginning to be familiar with this kind of exercise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis well, or abyss, was a narrow cleft in the mass of the granite,\\r\\ncalled by geologists a \\'fault,\\' and caused by the unequal cooling of\\r\\nthe globe of the earth. If it had at one time been a passage for\\r\\neruptive matter thrown out by Snaefell, I still could not understand\\r\\nwhy no trace was left of its passage. We kept going down a kind of\\r\\nwinding staircase, which seemed almost to have been made by the hand\\r\\nof man.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery quarter of an hour we were obliged to halt, to take a little\\r\\nnecessary repose and restore the action of our limbs. We then sat\\r\\ndown upon a fragment of rock, and we talked as we ate and drank from\\r\\nthe stream.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, down this fault the Hansbach fell in a cascade, and lost\\r\\nsome of its volume; but there was enough and to spare to slake our\\r\\nthirst. Besides, when the incline became more gentle, it would of\\r\\ncourse resume its peaceable course. At this moment it reminded me of\\r\\nmy worthy uncle, in his frequent fits of impatience and anger, while\\r\\nbelow it ran with the calmness of the Icelandic hunter.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 6th and 7th of July we kept following the spiral curves of\\r\\nthis singular well, penetrating in actual distance no more than two\\r\\nleagues; but being carried to a depth of five leagues below the level\\r\\nof the sea. But on the 8th, about noon, the fault took, towards the\\r\\nsouth-east, a much gentler slope, one of about forty-five degrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the road became monotonously easy. It could not be otherwise,\\r\\nfor there was no landscape to vary the stages of our journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Wednesday, the 15th, we were seven leagues underground, and had\\r\\ntravelled fifty leagues away from Snaefell. Although we were tired,\\r\\nour health was perfect, and the medicine chest had not yet had\\r\\noccasion to be opened.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle noted every hour the indications of the compass, the\\r\\nchronometer, the aneroid, and the thermometer the very same which he\\r\\nhas published in his scientific report of our journey. It was\\r\\ntherefore not difficult to know exactly our whereabouts. When he told\\r\\nme that we had gone fifty leagues horizontally, I could not repress\\r\\nan exclamation of astonishment, at the thought that we had now long\\r\\nleft Iceland behind us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter?\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was reflecting that if your calculations are correct we are no\\r\\nlonger under Iceland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not mistaken,\" I said, and examining the map, I added, \"We have\\r\\npassed Cape Portland, and those fifty leagues bring us under the wide\\r\\nexpanse of ocean.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Under the sea,\" my uncle repeated, rubbing his hands with delight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can it be?\" I said. \"Is the ocean spread above our heads?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course, Axel. What can be more natural? At Newcastle are there\\r\\nnot coal mines extending far under the sea?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was all very well for the Professor to call this so simple, but I\\r\\ncould not feel quite easy at the thought that the boundless ocean was\\r\\nrolling over my head. And yet it really mattered very little whether\\r\\nit was the plains and mountains that covered our heads, or the\\r\\nAtlantic waves, as long as we were arched over by solid granite. And,\\r\\nbesides, I was getting used to this idea; for the tunnel, now running\\r\\nstraight, now winding as capriciously in its inclines as in its\\r\\nturnings, but constantly preserving its south-easterly direction, and\\r\\nalways running deeper, was gradually carrying us to very great depths\\r\\nindeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour days later, Saturday, the 18th of July, in the evening, we\\r\\narrived at a kind of vast grotto; and here my uncle paid Hans his\\r\\nweekly wages, and it was settled that the next day, Sunday, should be\\r\\na day of rest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXV.\\r\\n\\r\\nDE PROFUNDIS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI therefore awoke next day relieved from the preoccupation of an\\r\\nimmediate start. Although we were in the very deepest of known\\r\\ndepths, there was something not unpleasant about it. And, besides, we\\r\\nwere beginning to get accustomed to this troglodyte [1] life. I no\\r\\nlonger thought of sun, moon, and stars, trees, houses, and towns, nor\\r\\nof any of those terrestrial superfluities which are necessaries of\\r\\nmen who live upon the earth\\'s surface. Being fossils, we looked upon\\r\\nall those things as mere jokes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grotto was an immense apartment. Along its granite floor ran our\\r\\nfaithful stream. At this distance from its spring the water was\\r\\nscarcely tepid, and we drank of it with pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter breakfast the Professor gave a few hours to the arrangement of\\r\\nhis daily notes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"First,\" said he, \"I will make a calculation to ascertain our exact\\r\\nposition. I hope, after our return, to draw a map of our journey,\\r\\nwhich will be in reality a vertical section of the globe, containing\\r\\nthe track of our expedition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will be curious, uncle; but are your observations sufficiently\\r\\naccurate to enable you to do this correctly?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; I have everywhere observed the angles and the inclines. I am\\r\\nsure there is no error. Let us see where we are now. Take your\\r\\ncompass, and note the direction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked, and replied carefully:\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] tpwgln, a hole; dnw, to creep into. The name of an Ethiopian\\r\\ntribe who lived in caves and holes. ??????, a hole, and ???, to creep\\r\\ninto.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"South-east by east.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" answered the Professor, after a rapid calculation, \"I infer\\r\\nthat we have gone eighty-five leagues since we started.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Therefore we are under mid-Atlantic?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure we are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And perhaps at this very moment there is a storm above, and ships\\r\\nover our heads are being rudely tossed by the tempest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite probable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And whales are lashing the roof of our prison with their tails?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may be, Axel, but they won\\'t shake us here. But let us go back to\\r\\nour calculation. Here we are eighty-five leagues south-east of\\r\\nSnaefell, and I reckon that we are at a depth of sixteen leagues.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sixteen leagues?\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No doubt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, this is the very limit assigned by science to the thickness of\\r\\nthe crust of the earth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t deny it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And here, according to the law of increasing temperature, there\\r\\nought to be a heat of 2,732 deg. Fahr.!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So there should, my lad.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And all this solid granite ought to be running in fusion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see that it is not so, and that, as so often happens, facts come\\r\\nto overthrow theories.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am obliged to agree; but, after all, it is surprising.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does the thermometer say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Twenty-seven, six tenths (82 deg. Fahr.).\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Therefore the savants are wrong by 2,705 deg., and the proportional\\r\\nincrease is a mistake. Therefore Humphry Davy was right, and I am not\\r\\nwrong in following him. What do you say now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn truth, I had a good deal to say. I gave way in no respect to\\r\\nDavy\\'s theory. I still held to the central heat, although I did not\\r\\nfeel its effects. I preferred to admit in truth, that this chimney of\\r\\nan extinct volcano, lined with lavas, which are non-conductors of\\r\\nheat, did not suffer the heat to pass through its walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut without stopping to look up new arguments I simply took up our\\r\\nsituation such as it was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, admitting all your calculations to be quite correct, you must\\r\\nallow me to draw one rigid result therefrom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it. Speak freely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the latitude of Iceland, where we now are, the radius of the\\r\\nearth, the distance from the centre to the surface is about 1,583\\r\\nleagues; let us say in round numbers 1,600 leagues, or 4,800 miles.\\r\\nOut of 1,600 leagues we have gone twelve!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So you say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And these twelve at a cost of 85 leagues diagonally?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In twenty days?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, sixteen leagues are the hundredth part of the earth\\'s radius.\\r\\nAt this rate we shall be two thousand days, or nearly five years and\\r\\na half, in getting to the centre.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo answer was vouchsafed to this rational conclusion. \"Without\\r\\nreckoning, too, that if a vertical depth of sixteen leagues can be\\r\\nattained only by a diagonal descent of eighty-four, it follows that\\r\\nwe must go eight thousand miles in a south-easterly direction; so\\r\\nthat we shall emerge from some point in the earth\\'s circumference\\r\\ninstead of getting to the centre!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Confusion to all your figures, and all your hypotheses besides,\"\\r\\nshouted my uncle in a sudden rage. \"What is the basis of them all?\\r\\nHow do you know that this passage does not run straight to our\\r\\ndestination? Besides, there is a precedent. What one man has done,\\r\\nanother may do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope so; but, still, I may be permitted--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall have my leave to hold your tongue, Axel, but not to talk\\r\\nin that irrational way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI could see the awful Professor bursting through my uncle\\'s skin, and\\r\\nI took timely warning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now look at your aneroid. What does that say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It says we are under considerable pressure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good; so you see that by going gradually down, and getting\\r\\naccustomed to the density of the atmosphere, we don\\'t suffer at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing, except a little pain in the ears.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s nothing, and you may get rid of even that by quick breathing\\r\\nwhenever you feel the pain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly so,\" I said, determined not to say a word that might cross\\r\\nmy uncle\\'s prejudices. \"There is even positive pleasure in living in\\r\\nthis dense atmosphere. Have you observed how intense sound is down\\r\\nhere?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No doubt it is. A deaf man would soon learn to hear perfectly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But won\\'t this density augment?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; according to a rather obscure law. It is well known that the\\r\\nweight of bodies diminishes as fast as we descend. You know that it\\r\\nis at the surface of the globe that weight is most sensibly felt, and\\r\\nthat at the centre there is no weight at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am aware of that; but, tell me, will not air at last acquire the\\r\\ndensity of water?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course, under a pressure of seven hundred and ten atmospheres.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how, lower down still?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lower down the density will still increase.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how shall we go down then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, we must fill our pockets with stones.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, indeed, my worthy uncle, you are never at a loss for an\\r\\nanswer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI dared venture no farther into the region of probabilities, for I\\r\\nmight presently have stumbled upon an impossibility, which would have\\r\\nbrought the Professor on the scene when he was not wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, it was evident that the air, under a pressure which might\\r\\nreach that of thousands of atmospheres, would at last reach the solid\\r\\nstate, and then, even if our bodies could resist the strain, we\\r\\nshould be stopped, and no reasonings would be able to get us on any\\r\\nfarther.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I did not advance this argument. My uncle would have met it with\\r\\nhis inevitable Saknussemm, a precedent which possessed no weight with\\r\\nme; for even if the journey of the learned Icelander were really\\r\\nattested, there was one very simple answer, that in the sixteenth\\r\\ncentury there was neither barometer or aneroid and therefore\\r\\nSaknussemm could not tell how far he had gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I kept this objection to myself, and waited the course of events.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the day was passed in calculations and in conversations.\\r\\nI remained a steadfast adherent of the opinions of Professor\\r\\nLiedenbrock, and I envied the stolid indifference of Hans, who,\\r\\nwithout going into causes and effects, went on with his eyes shut\\r\\nwherever his destiny guided him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WORST PERIL OF ALL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt must be confessed that hitherto things had not gone on so badly,\\r\\nand that I had small reason to complain. If our difficulties became\\r\\nno worse, we might hope to reach our end. And to what a height of\\r\\nscientific glory we should then attain! I had become quite a\\r\\nLiedenbrock in my reasonings; seriously I had. But would this state\\r\\nof things last in the strange place we had come to? Perhaps it might.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor several days steeper inclines, some even frightfully near to the\\r\\nperpendicular, brought us deeper and deeper into the mass of the\\r\\ninterior of the earth. Some days we advanced nearer to the centre by\\r\\na league and a half, or nearly two leagues. These were perilous\\r\\ndescents, in which the skill and marvellous coolness of Hans were\\r\\ninvaluable to us. That unimpassioned Icelander devoted himself with\\r\\nincomprehensible deliberation; and, thanks to him, we crossed many a\\r\\ndangerous spot which we should never have cleared alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut his habit of silence gained upon him day by day, and was\\r\\ninfecting us. External objects produce decided effects upon the\\r\\nbrain. A man shut up between four walls soon loses the power to\\r\\nassociate words and ideas together. How many prisoners in solitary\\r\\nconfinement become idiots, if not mad, for want of exercise for the\\r\\nthinking faculty!\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the fortnight following our last conversation, no incident\\r\\noccurred worthy of being recorded. But I have good reason for\\r\\nremembering one very serious event which took place at this time, and\\r\\nof which I could scarcely now forget the smallest details.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 7th of August our successive descents had brought us to a\\r\\ndepth of thirty leagues; that is, that for a space of thirty leagues\\r\\nthere were over our heads solid beds of rock, ocean, continents, and\\r\\ntowns. We must have been two hundred leagues from Iceland.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn that day the tunnel went down a gentle slope. I was ahead of the\\r\\nothers. My uncle was carrying one of Ruhmkorff\\'s lamps and I the\\r\\nother. I was examining the beds of granite.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly turning round I observed that I was alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, well, I thought; I have been going too fast, or Hans and my\\r\\nuncle have stopped on the way. Come, this won\\'t do; I must join them.\\r\\nFortunately there is not much of an ascent.\\r\\n\\r\\nI retraced my steps. I walked for a quarter of an hour. I gazed into\\r\\nthe darkness. I shouted. No reply: my voice was lost in the midst of\\r\\nthe cavernous echoes which alone replied to my call.\\r\\n\\r\\nI began to feel uneasy. A shudder ran through me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Calmly!\" I said aloud to myself, \"I am sure to find my companions\\r\\nagain. There are not two roads. I was too far ahead. I will return!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor half an hour I climbed up. I listened for a call, and in that\\r\\ndense atmosphere a voice could reach very far. But there was a dreary\\r\\nsilence in all that long gallery. I stopped. I could not believe that\\r\\nI was lost. I was only bewildered for a time, not lost. I was sure I\\r\\nshould find my way again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" I repeated, \"since there is but one road, and they are on it,\\r\\nI must find them again. I have but to ascend still. Unless, indeed,\\r\\nmissing me, and supposing me to be behind, they too should have gone\\r\\nback. But even in this case I have only to make the greater haste. I\\r\\nshall find them, I am sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI repeated these words in the fainter tones of a half-convinced man.\\r\\nBesides, to associate even such simple ideas with words, and reason\\r\\nwith them, was a work of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nA doubt then seized upon me. Was I indeed in advance when we became\\r\\nseparated? Yes, to be sure I was. Hans was after me, preceding my\\r\\nuncle. He had even stopped for a while to strap his baggage better\\r\\nover his shoulders. I could remember this little incident. It was at\\r\\nthat very moment that I must have gone on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides, I thought, have not I a guarantee that I shall not lose my\\r\\nway, a clue in the labyrinth, that cannot be broken, my faithful\\r\\nstream? I have but to trace it back, and I must come upon them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis conclusion revived my spirits, and I resolved to resume my march\\r\\nwithout loss of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow I then blessed my uncle\\'s foresight in preventing the hunter from\\r\\nstopping up the hole in the granite. This beneficent spring, after\\r\\nhaving satisfied our thirst on the road, would now be my guide among\\r\\nthe windings of the terrestrial crust.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore starting afresh I thought a wash would do me good. I stooped\\r\\nto bathe my face in the Hansbach.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo my stupefaction and utter dismay my feet trod only--the rough dry\\r\\ngranite. The stream was no longer at my feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nLOST IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo describe my despair would be impossible. No words could tell it. I\\r\\nwas buried alive, with the prospect before me of dying of hunger and\\r\\nthirst.\\r\\n\\r\\nMechanically I swept the ground with my hands. How dry and hard the\\r\\nrock seemed to me!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how had I left the course of the stream? For it was a terrible\\r\\nfact that it no longer ran at my side. Then I understood the reason\\r\\nof that fearful, silence, when for the last time I listened to hear\\r\\nif any sound from my companions could reach my ears. At the moment\\r\\nwhen I left the right road I had not noticed the absence of the\\r\\nstream. It is evident that at that moment a deviation had presented\\r\\nitself before me, whilst the Hansbach, following the caprice of\\r\\nanother incline, had gone with my companions away into unknown depths.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow was I to return? There was not a trace of their footsteps or of\\r\\nmy own, for the foot left no mark upon the granite floor. I racked my\\r\\nbrain for a solution of this impracticable problem. One word\\r\\ndescribed my position. Lost!\\r\\n\\r\\nLost at an immeasurable depth! Thirty leagues of rock seemed to weigh\\r\\nupon my shoulders with a dreadful pressure. I felt crushed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried to carry back my ideas to things on the surface of the earth.\\r\\nI could scarcely succeed. Hamburg, the house in the Koenigstrasse, my\\r\\npoor Graeuben, all that busy world underneath which I was wandering\\r\\nabout, was passing in rapid confusion before my terrified memory. I\\r\\ncould revive with vivid reality all the incidents of our voyage,\\r\\nIceland, M. Fridrikssen, Snaefell. I said to myself that if, in such a\\r\\nposition as I was now in, I was fool enough to cling to one glimpse\\r\\nof hope, it would be madness, and that the best thing I could do was\\r\\nto despair.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat human power could restore me to the light of the sun by rending\\r\\nasunder the huge arches of rock which united over my head,\\r\\nbuttressing each other with impregnable strength? Who could place my\\r\\nfeet on the right path, and bring me back to my company?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my uncle!\" burst from my lips in the tone of despair.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was my only word of reproach, for I knew how much he must be\\r\\nsuffering in seeking me, wherever he might be.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I saw myself thus far removed from all earthly help I had\\r\\nrecourse to heavenly succour. The remembrance of my childhood, the\\r\\nrecollection of my mother, whom I had only known in my tender early\\r\\nyears, came back to me, and I knelt in prayer imploring for the\\r\\nDivine help of which I was so little worthy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis return of trust in God\\'s providence allayed the turbulence of my\\r\\nfears, and I was enabled to concentrate upon my situation all the\\r\\nforce of my intelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had three days\\' provisions with me and my flask was full. But I\\r\\ncould not remain alone for long. Should I go up or down?\\r\\n\\r\\nUp, of course; up continually.\\r\\n\\r\\nI must thus arrive at the point where I had left the stream, that\\r\\nfatal turn in the road. With the stream at my feet, I might hope to\\r\\nregain the summit of Snaefell.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy had I not thought of that sooner? Here was evidently a chance of\\r\\nsafety. The most pressing duty was to find out again the course of\\r\\nthe Hansbach. I rose, and leaning upon my iron-pointed stick I\\r\\nascended the gallery. The slope was rather steep. I walked on without\\r\\nhope but without indecision, like a man who has made up his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor half an hour I met with no obstacle. I tried to recognise my way\\r\\nby the form of the tunnel, by the projections of certain rocks, by\\r\\nthe disposition of the fractures. But no particular sign appeared,\\r\\nand I soon saw that this gallery could not bring me back to the\\r\\nturning point. It came to an abrupt end. I struck against an\\r\\nimpenetrable wall, and fell down upon the rock.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnspeakable despair then seized upon me. I lay overwhelmed, aghast!\\r\\nMy last hope was shattered against this granite wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nLost in this labyrinth, whose windings crossed each other in all\\r\\ndirections, it was no use to think of flight any longer. Here I must\\r\\ndie the most dreadful of deaths. And, strange to say, the thought\\r\\ncame across me that when some day my petrified remains should be\\r\\nfound thirty leagues below the surface in the bowels of the earth,\\r\\nthe discovery might lead to grave scientific discussions.\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried to speak aloud, but hoarse sounds alone passed my dry lips. I\\r\\npanted for breath.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the midst of my agony a new terror laid hold of me. In falling my\\r\\nlamp had got wrong. I could not set it right, and its light was\\r\\npaling and would soon disappear altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gazed painfully upon the luminous current growing weaker and weaker\\r\\nin the wire coil. A dim procession of moving shadows seemed slowly\\r\\nunfolding down the darkening walls. I scarcely dared to shut my eyes\\r\\nfor one moment, for fear of losing the least glimmer of this precious\\r\\nlight. Every instant it seemed about to vanish and the dense\\r\\nblackness to come rolling in palpably upon me.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne last trembling glimmer shot feebly up. I watched it in trembling\\r\\nand anxiety; I drank it in as if I could preserve it, concentrating\\r\\nupon it the full power of my eyes, as upon the very last sensation of\\r\\nlight which they were ever to experience, and the next moment I lay\\r\\nin the heavy gloom of deep, thick, unfathomable darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nA terrible cry of anguish burst from me. Upon earth, in the midst of\\r\\nthe darkest night, light never abdicates its functions altogether. It\\r\\nis still subtle and diffusive, but whatever little there may be, the\\r\\neye still catches that little. Here there was not an atom; the total\\r\\ndarkness made me totally blind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I began to lose my head. I arose with my arms stretched out\\r\\nbefore me, attempting painfully to feel my way. I began to run\\r\\nwildly, hurrying through the inextricable maze, still descending,\\r\\nstill running through the substance of the earth\\'s thick crust, a\\r\\nstruggling denizen of geological \\'faults,\\' crying, shouting, yelling,\\r\\nsoon bruised by contact with the jagged rock, falling and rising\\r\\nagain bleeding, trying to drink the blood which covered my face, and\\r\\neven waiting for some rock to shatter my skull against.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall never know whither my mad career took me. After the lapse of\\r\\nsome hours, no doubt exhausted, I fell like a lifeless lump at the\\r\\nfoot of the wall, and lost all consciousness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RESCUE IN THE WHISPERING GALLERY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I returned to partial life my face was wet with tears. How long\\r\\nthat state of insensibility had lasted I cannot say. I had no means\\r\\nnow of taking account of time. Never was solitude equal to this,\\r\\nnever had any living being been so utterly forsaken.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter my fall I had lost a good deal of blood. I felt it flowing over\\r\\nme. Ah! how happy I should have been could I have died, and if death\\r\\nwere not yet to be gone through. I would think no longer. I drove\\r\\naway every idea, and, conquered by my grief, I rolled myself to the\\r\\nfoot of the opposite wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready I was feeling the approach of another faint, and was hoping\\r\\nfor complete annihilation, when a loud noise reached me. It was like\\r\\nthe distant rumble of continuous thunder, and I could hear its\\r\\nsounding undulations rolling far away into the remote recesses of the\\r\\nabyss.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhence could this noise proceed? It must be from some phenomenon\\r\\nproceeding in the great depths amidst which I lay helpless. Was it an\\r\\nexplosion of gas? Was it the fall of some mighty pillar of the globe?\\r\\n\\r\\nI listened still. I wanted to know if the noise would be repeated. A\\r\\nquarter of an hour passed away. Silence reigned in this gallery. I\\r\\ncould not hear even the beating of my heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly my ear, resting by chance against the wall, caught, or\\r\\nseemed to catch, certain vague, indescribable, distant, articulate\\r\\nsounds, as of words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a delusion,\" I thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was not. Listening more attentively, I heard in reality a\\r\\nmurmuring of voices. But my weakness prevented me from understanding\\r\\nwhat the voices said. Yet it was language, I was sure of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment I feared the words might be my own, brought back by the\\r\\necho. Perhaps I had been crying out unknown to myself. I closed my\\r\\nlips firmly, and laid my ear against the wall again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, truly, some one is speaking; those are words!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEven a few feet from the wall I could hear distinctly. I succeeded in\\r\\ncatching uncertain, strange, undistinguishable words. They came as if\\r\\npronounced in low murmured whispers. The word \\'_forlorad_\\' was\\r\\nseveral times repeated in a tone of sympathy and sorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Help!\" I cried with all my might. \"Help!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI listened, I watched in the darkness for an answer, a cry, a mere\\r\\nbreath of sound, but nothing came. Some minutes passed. A whole world\\r\\nof ideas had opened in my mind. I thought that my weakened voice\\r\\ncould never penetrate to my companions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is they,\" I repeated. \"What other men can be thirty leagues under\\r\\nground?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI again began to listen. Passing my ear over the wall from one place\\r\\nto another, I found the point where the voices seemed to be best\\r\\nheard. The word \\'_forlorad_\\' again returned; then the rolling of\\r\\nthunder which had roused me from my lethargy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" I said, \"no; it is not through such a mass that a voice can be\\r\\nheard. I am surrounded by granite walls, and the loudest explosion\\r\\ncould never be heard here! This noise comes along the gallery. There\\r\\nmust be here some remarkable exercise of acoustic laws!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI listened again, and this time, yes this time, I did distinctly hear\\r\\nmy name pronounced across the wide interval.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was my uncle\\'s own voice! He was talking to the guide. And\\r\\n\\'_forlorad_\\' is a Danish word.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I understood it all. To make myself heard, I must speak along\\r\\nthis wall, which would conduct the sound of my voice just as wire\\r\\nconducts electricity.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was no time to lose. If my companions moved but a few steps\\r\\naway, the acoustic phenomenon would cease. I therefore approached the\\r\\nwall, and pronounced these words as clearly as possible:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Uncle Liedenbrock!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI waited with the deepest anxiety. Sound does not travel with great\\r\\nvelocity. Even increased density air has no effect upon its rate of\\r\\ntravelling; it merely augments its intensity. Seconds, which seemed\\r\\nages, passed away, and at last these words reached me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Axel! Axel! is it you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes,\" I replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My boy, where are you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lost, in the deepest darkness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is your lamp?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the stream?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Disappeared.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Axel, Axel, take courage!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait! I am exhausted! I can\\'t answer. Speak to me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Courage,\" resumed my uncle. \"Don\\'t speak. Listen to me. We have\\r\\nlooked for you up the gallery and down the gallery. Could not find\\r\\nyou. I wept for you, my poor boy. At last, supposing you were still\\r\\non the Hansbach, we fired our guns. Our voices are audible to each\\r\\nother, but our hands cannot touch. But don\\'t despair, Axel! It is a\\r\\ngreat thing that we can hear each other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this time I had been reflecting. A vague hope was returning to\\r\\nmy heart. There was one thing I must know to begin with. I placed my\\r\\nlips close to the wall, saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My uncle!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My boy!\" came to me after a few seconds.\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must know how far we are apart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is easy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have your chronometer?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, take it. Pronounce my name, noting exactly the second when you\\r\\nspeak. I will repeat it as soon as it shall come to me, and you will\\r\\nobserve the exact moment when you get my answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; and half the time between my call and your answer will exactly\\r\\nindicate that which my voice will take in coming to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just so, my uncle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you ready?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, attention. I am going to call your name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nI put my ear to the wall, and as soon as the name \\'Axel\\' came I\\r\\nimmediately replied \"Axel,\" then waited.\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Forty seconds,\" said my uncle. \"Forty seconds between the two words;\\r\\nso the sound takes twenty seconds in coming. Now, at the rate of\\r\\n1,120 feet in a second, this is 22,400 feet, or four miles and a\\r\\nquarter, nearly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Four miles and a quarter!\" I murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will soon be over, Axel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Must I go up or down?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Down--for this reason: We are in a vast chamber, with endless\\r\\ngalleries. Yours must lead into it, for it seems as if all the clefts\\r\\nand fractures of the globe radiated round this vast cavern. So get\\r\\nup, and begin walking. Walk on, drag yourself along, if necessary\\r\\nslide down the steep places, and at the end you will find us ready to\\r\\nreceive you. Now begin moving.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words cheered me up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good bye, uncle.\" I cried. \"I am going. There will be no more voices\\r\\nheard when once I have started. So good bye!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good bye, Axel, _au revoir!_\"\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were the last words I heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis wonderful underground conversation, carried on with a distance\\r\\nof four miles and a quarter between us, concluded with these words of\\r\\nhope. I thanked God from my heart, for it was He who had conducted me\\r\\nthrough those vast solitudes to the point where, alone of all others\\r\\nperhaps, the voices of my companions could have reached me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis acoustic effect is easily explained on scientific grounds. It\\r\\narose from the concave form of the gallery and the conducting power\\r\\nof the rock. There are many examples of this propagation of sounds\\r\\nwhich remain unheard in the intermediate space. I remember that a\\r\\nsimilar phenomenon has been observed in many places; amongst others\\r\\non the internal surface of the gallery of the dome of St. Paul\\'s in\\r\\nLondon, and especially in the midst of the curious caverns among the\\r\\nquarries near Syracuse, the most wonderful of which is called\\r\\nDionysius\\' Ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese remembrances came into my mind, and I clearly saw that since my\\r\\nuncle\\'s voice really reached me, there could be no obstacle between\\r\\nus. Following the direction by which the sound came, of course I\\r\\nshould arrive in his presence, if my strength did not fail me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI therefore rose; I rather dragged myself than walked. The slope was\\r\\nrapid, and I slid down.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon the swiftness of the descent increased horribly, and threatened\\r\\nto become a fall. I no longer had the strength to stop myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly there was no ground under me. I felt myself revolving in\\r\\nair, striking and rebounding against the craggy projections of a\\r\\nvertical gallery, quite a well; my head struck against a sharp corner\\r\\nof the rock, and I became unconscious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHALATTA! THALATTA!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I came to myself, I was stretched in half darkness, covered with\\r\\nthick coats and blankets. My uncle was watching over me, to discover\\r\\nthe least sign of life. At my first sigh he took my hand; when I\\r\\nopened my eyes he uttered a cry of joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He lives! he lives!\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I am still alive,\" I answered feebly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear nephew,\" said my uncle, pressing me to his breast, \"you are\\r\\nsaved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was deeply touched with the tenderness of his manner as he uttered\\r\\nthese words, and still more with the care with which he watched over\\r\\nme. But such trials were wanted to bring out the Professor\\'s tenderer\\r\\nqualities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment Hans came, he saw my hand in my uncle\\'s, and I may\\r\\nsafely say that there was joy in his countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_God dag,_\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you do, Hans? How are you? And now, uncle, tell me where we\\r\\nare at the present moment?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To-morrow, Axel, to-morrow. Now you are too faint and weak. I have\\r\\nbandaged your head with compresses which must not be disturbed. Sleep\\r\\nnow, and to-morrow I will tell you all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But do tell me what time it is, and what day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is Sunday, the 8th of August, and it is ten at night. You must\\r\\nask me no more questions until the 10th.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn truth I was very weak, and my eyes involuntarily closed. I wanted\\r\\na good night\\'s rest; and I therefore went off to sleep, with the\\r\\nknowledge that I had been four long days alone in the heart of the\\r\\nearth.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning, on awakening, I looked round me. My couch, made up of\\r\\nall our travelling gear, was in a charming grotto, adorned with\\r\\nsplendid stalactites, and the soil of which was a fine sand. It was\\r\\nhalf light. There was no torch, no lamp, yet certain mysterious\\r\\nglimpses of light came from without through a narrow opening in the\\r\\ngrotto. I heard too a vague and indistinct noise, something like the\\r\\nmurmuring of waves breaking upon a shingly shore, and at times I\\r\\nseemed to hear the whistling of wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wondered whether I was awake, whether I was dreaming, whether my brain,\\r\\ncrazed by my fall, was not affected by imaginary noises. Yet neither\\r\\neyes, nor ears could be so utterly deceived.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a ray of daylight, I thought, sliding in through this cleft in\\r\\nthe rock! That is indeed the murmuring of waves! That is the rustling\\r\\nnoise of wind. Am I quite mistaken, or have we returned to the\\r\\nsurface of the earth? Has my uncle given up the expedition, or is it\\r\\nhappily terminated?\\r\\n\\r\\nI was asking myself these unanswerable questions when the Professor\\r\\nentered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good morning, Axel,\" he cried cheerily. \"I feel sure you are better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I am indeed,\" said I, sitting up on my couch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can hardly fail to be better, for you have slept quietly. Hans\\r\\nand I watched you by turns, and we have noticed you were evidently\\r\\nrecovering.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, I do feel a great deal better, and I will give you a proof\\r\\nof that presently if you will let me have my breakfast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall eat, lad. The fever has left you. Hans rubbed your wounds\\r\\nwith some ointment or other of which the Icelanders keep the secret,\\r\\nand they have healed marvellously. Our hunter is a splendid fellow!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst he went on talking, my uncle prepared a few provisions, which\\r\\nI devoured eagerly, notwithstanding his advice to the contrary. All\\r\\nthe while I was overwhelming him with questions which he answered\\r\\nreadily.\\r\\n\\r\\nI then learnt that my providential fall had brought me exactly to the\\r\\nextremity of an almost perpendicular shaft; and as I had landed in\\r\\nthe midst of an accompanying torrent of stones, the least of which\\r\\nwould have been enough to crush me, the conclusion was that a loose\\r\\nportion of the rock had come down with me. This frightful conveyance\\r\\nhad thus carried me into the arms of my uncle, where I fell bruised,\\r\\nbleeding, and insensible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Truly it is wonderful that you have not been killed a hundred times\\r\\nover. But, for the love of God, don\\'t let us ever separate again, or\\r\\nwe many never see each other more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not separate! Is the journey not over, then?\" I opened a pair of\\r\\nastonished eyes, which immediately called for the question:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter, Axel?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a question to ask you. You say that I am safe and sound?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No doubt you are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And all my limbs unbroken?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And my head?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your head, except for a few bruises, is all right; and it is on your\\r\\nshoulders, where it ought to be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I am afraid my brain is affected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your mind affected!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I fear so. Are we again on the surface of the globe?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, certainly not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I must be mad; for don\\'t I see the light of day, and don\\'t I\\r\\nhear the wind blowing, and the sea breaking on the shore?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! is that all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do tell me all about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t explain the inexplicable, but you will soon see and\\r\\nunderstand that geology has not yet learnt all it has to learn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then let us go,\" I answered quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Axel; the open air might be bad for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Open air?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; the wind is rather strong. You must not expose yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I assure you I am perfectly well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little patience, my nephew. A relapse might get us into trouble,\\r\\nand we have no time to lose, for the voyage may be a long one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The voyage!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, rest to-day, and to-morrow we will set sail.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Set sail!\"--and I almost leaped up.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat did it all mean? Had we a river, a lake, a sea to depend upon?\\r\\nWas there a ship at our disposal in some underground harbour?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy curiosity was highly excited, my uncle vainly tried to restrain\\r\\nme. When he saw that my impatience was doing me harm, he yielded.\\r\\n\\r\\nI dressed in haste. For greater safety I wrapped myself in a blanket,\\r\\nand came out of the grotto.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXX.\\r\\n\\r\\nA NEW MARE INTERNUM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first I could hardly see anything. My eyes, unaccustomed to the\\r\\nlight, quickly closed. When I was able to reopen them, I stood more\\r\\nstupefied even than surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The sea!\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" my uncle replied, \"the Liedenbrock Sea; and I don\\'t suppose\\r\\nany other discoverer will ever dispute my claim to name it after\\r\\nmyself as its first discoverer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA vast sheet of water, the commencement of a lake or an ocean, spread\\r\\nfar away beyond the range of the eye, reminding me forcibly of that\\r\\nopen sea which drew from Xenophon\\'s ten thousand Greeks, after their\\r\\nlong retreat, the simultaneous cry, \"Thalatta! thalatta!\" the sea!\\r\\nthe sea! The deeply indented shore was lined with a breadth of fine\\r\\nshining sand, softly lapped by the waves, and strewn with the small\\r\\nshells which had been inhabited by the first of created beings. The\\r\\nwaves broke on this shore with the hollow echoing murmur peculiar to\\r\\nvast inclosed spaces. A light foam flew over the waves before the\\r\\nbreath of a moderate breeze, and some of the spray fell upon my face.\\r\\nOn this slightly inclining shore, about a hundred fathoms from the\\r\\nlimit of the waves, came down the foot of a huge wall of vast cliffs,\\r\\nwhich rose majestically to an enormous height. Some of these,\\r\\ndividing the beach with their sharp spurs, formed capes and\\r\\npromontories, worn away by the ceaseless action of the surf. Farther\\r\\non the eye discerned their massive outline sharply defined against\\r\\nthe hazy distant horizon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was quite an ocean, with the irregular shores of earth, but desert\\r\\nand frightfully wild in appearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf my eyes were able to range afar over this great sea, it was\\r\\nbecause a peculiar light brought to view every detail of it. It was\\r\\nnot the light of the sun, with his dazzling shafts of brightness and\\r\\nthe splendour of his rays; nor was it the pale and uncertain shimmer\\r\\nof the moonbeams, the dim reflection of a nobler body of light. No;\\r\\nthe illuminating power of this light, its trembling diffusiveness,\\r\\nits bright, clear whiteness, and its low temperature, showed that it\\r\\nmust be of electric origin. It was like an aurora borealis, a\\r\\ncontinuous cosmical phenomenon, filling a cavern of sufficient extent\\r\\nto contain an ocean.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vault that spanned the space above, the sky, if it could be\\r\\ncalled so, seemed composed of vast plains of cloud, shifting and\\r\\nvariable vapours, which by their condensation must at certain times\\r\\nfall in torrents of rain. I should have thought that under so\\r\\npowerful a pressure of the atmosphere there could be no evaporation;\\r\\nand yet, under a law unknown to me, there were broad tracts of vapour\\r\\nsuspended in the air. But then \\'the weather was fine.\\' The play of\\r\\nthe electric light produced singular effects upon the upper strata of\\r\\ncloud. Deep shadows reposed upon their lower wreaths; and often,\\r\\nbetween two separated fields of cloud, there glided down a ray of\\r\\nunspeakable lustre. But it was not solar light, and there was no\\r\\nheat. The general effect was sad, supremely melancholy. Instead of\\r\\nthe shining firmament, spangled with its innumerable stars, shining\\r\\nsingly or in clusters, I felt that all these subdued and shaded\\r\\nlights were ribbed in by vast walls of granite, which seemed to\\r\\noverpower me with their weight, and that all this space, great as it\\r\\nwas, would not be enough for the march of the humblest of satellites.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I remembered the theory of an English captain, who likened the\\r\\nearth to a vast hollow sphere, in the interior of which the air\\r\\nbecame luminous because of the vast pressure that weighed upon it;\\r\\nwhile two stars, Pluto and Proserpine, rolled within upon the circuit\\r\\nof their mysterious orbits.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were in reality shut up inside an immeasurable excavation. Its\\r\\nwidth could not be estimated, since the shore ran widening as far as\\r\\neye could reach, nor could its length, for the dim horizon bounded\\r\\nthe new. As for its height, it must have been several leagues. Where\\r\\nthis vault rested upon its granite base no eye could tell; but there\\r\\nwas a cloud hanging far above, the height of which we estimated at\\r\\n12,000 feet, a greater height than that of any terrestrial vapour,\\r\\nand no doubt due to the great density of the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word cavern does not convey any idea of this immense space; words\\r\\nof human tongue are inadequate to describe the discoveries of him who\\r\\nventures into the deep abysses of earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides I could not tell upon what geological theory to account for\\r\\nthe existence of such an excavation. Had the cooling of the globe\\r\\nproduced it? I knew of celebrated caverns from the descriptions of\\r\\ntravellers, but had never heard of any of such dimensions as this.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the grotto of Guachara, in Colombia, visited by Humboldt, had not\\r\\ngiven up the whole of the secret of its depth to the philosopher, who\\r\\ninvestigated it to the depth of 2,500 feet, it probably did not\\r\\nextend much farther. The immense mammoth cave in Kentucky is of\\r\\ngigantic proportions, since its vaulted roof rises five hundred feet\\r\\n[1] above the level of an unfathomable lake and travellers have\\r\\nexplored its ramifications to the extent of forty miles. But what\\r\\nwere these cavities compared to that in which I stood with wonder and\\r\\nadmiration, with its sky of luminous vapours, its bursts of electric\\r\\nlight, and a vast sea filling its bed? My imagination fell powerless\\r\\nbefore such immensity.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gazed upon these wonders in silence. Words failed me to express my\\r\\nfeelings. I felt as if I was in some distant planet Uranus or\\r\\nNeptune--and in the presence of phenomena of which my terrestrial\\r\\nexperience gave me no cognisance. For such novel sensations, new words\\r\\nwere wanted; and my imagination failed to supply them. I gazed, I\\r\\nthought, I admired, with a stupefaction mingled with a certain amount of\\r\\nfear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unforeseen nature of this spectacle brought back the colour to my\\r\\ncheeks. I was under a new course of treatment with the aid of\\r\\nastonishment, and my convalescence was promoted by this novel system\\r\\nof therapeutics; besides, the dense and breezy air invigorated me,\\r\\nsupplying more oxygen to my lungs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be easily conceived that after an imprisonment of forty seven\\r\\ndays in a narrow gallery it was the height of physical enjoyment to\\r\\nbreathe a moist air impregnated with saline particles.\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] One hundred and twenty. (Trans.)\\r\\n\\r\\nI was delighted to leave my dark grotto. My uncle, already familiar\\r\\nwith these wonders, had ceased to feel surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You feel strong enough to walk a little way now?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, certainly; and nothing could be more delightful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, take my arm, Axel, and let us follow the windings of the\\r\\nshore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI eagerly accepted, and we began to coast along this new sea. On the\\r\\nleft huge pyramids of rock, piled one upon another, produced a\\r\\nprodigious titanic effect. Down their sides flowed numberless\\r\\nwaterfalls, which went on their way in brawling but pellucid streams.\\r\\nA few light vapours, leaping from rock to rock, denoted the place of\\r\\nhot springs; and streams flowed softly down to the common basin,\\r\\ngliding down the gentle slopes with a softer murmur.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst these streams I recognised our faithful travelling companion,\\r\\nthe Hansbach, coming to lose its little volume quietly in the mighty\\r\\nsea, just as if it had done nothing else since the beginning of the\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall see it no more,\" I said, with a sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What matters,\" replied the philosopher, \"whether this or another\\r\\nserves to guide us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought him rather ungrateful.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at that moment my attention was drawn to an unexpected sight. At\\r\\na distance of five hundred paces, at the turn of a high promontory,\\r\\nappeared a high, tufted, dense forest. It was composed of trees of\\r\\nmoderate height, formed like umbrellas, with exact geometrical\\r\\noutlines. The currents of wind seemed to have had no effect upon\\r\\ntheir shape, and in the midst of the windy blasts they stood unmoved\\r\\nand firm, just like a clump of petrified cedars.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hastened forward. I could not give any name to these singular\\r\\ncreations. Were they some of the two hundred thousand species of\\r\\nvegetables known hitherto, and did they claim a place of their own in\\r\\nthe lacustrine flora? No; when we arrived under their shade my\\r\\nsurprise turned into admiration. There stood before me productions of\\r\\nearth, but of gigantic stature, which my uncle immediately named.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is only a forest of mushrooms,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he was right. Imagine the large development attained by these\\r\\nplants, which prefer a warm, moist climate. I knew that the\\r\\n_Lycopodon giganteum_ attains, according to Bulliard, a circumference\\r\\nof eight or nine feet; but here were pale mushrooms, thirty to forty\\r\\nfeet high, and crowned with a cap of equal diameter. There they stood\\r\\nin thousands. No light could penetrate between their huge cones, and\\r\\ncomplete darkness reigned beneath those giants; they formed\\r\\nsettlements of domes placed in close array like the round, thatched\\r\\nroofs of a central African city.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet I wanted to penetrate farther underneath, though a chill fell\\r\\nupon me as soon as I came under those cellular vaults. For half an\\r\\nhour we wandered from side to side in the damp shades, and it was a\\r\\ncomfortable and pleasant change to arrive once more upon the sea\\r\\nshore.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the subterranean vegetation was not confined to these fungi.\\r\\nFarther on rose groups of tall trees of colourless foliage and easy\\r\\nto recognise. They were lowly shrubs of earth, here attaining\\r\\ngigantic size; lycopodiums, a hundred feet high; the huge sigillaria,\\r\\nfound in our coal mines; tree ferns, as tall as our fir-trees in\\r\\nnorthern latitudes; lepidodendra, with cylindrical forked stems,\\r\\nterminated by long leaves, and bristling with rough hairs like those\\r\\nof the cactus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wonderful, magnificent, splendid!\" cried my uncle. \"Here is the\\r\\nentire flora of the second period of the world--the transition\\r\\nperiod. These, humble garden plants with us, were tall trees in the\\r\\nearly ages. Look, Axel, and admire it all. Never had botanist such a\\r\\nfeast as this!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are right, my uncle. Providence seems to have preserved in this\\r\\nimmense conservatory the antediluvian plants which the wisdom of\\r\\nphilosophers has so sagaciously put together again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a conservatory, Axel; but is it not also a menagerie?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surely not a menagerie!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; no doubt of it. Look at that dust under your feet; see the\\r\\nbones scattered on the ground.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So there are!\" I cried; \"bones of extinct animals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had rushed upon these remains, formed of indestructible phosphates\\r\\nof lime, and without hesitation I named these monstrous bones, which\\r\\nlay scattered about like decayed trunks of trees.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is the lower jaw of a mastodon,\" [1] I said. \"These are the\\r\\nmolar teeth of the deinotherium; this femur must have belonged to the\\r\\ngreatest of those beasts, the megatherium. It certainly is a\\r\\nmenagerie, for these remains were not brought here by a deluge. The\\r\\nanimals to which they belonged roamed on the shores of this\\r\\nsubterranean sea, under the shade of those arborescent trees. Here\\r\\nare entire skeletons. And yet I cannot understand the appearance of\\r\\nthese quadrupeds in a granite cavern.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] These animals belonged to a late geological period, the Pliocene,\\r\\njust before the glacial epoch, and therefore could have no connection\\r\\nwith the carboniferous vegetation. (Trans.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because animal life existed upon the earth only in the secondary\\r\\nperiod, when a sediment of soil had been deposited by the rivers, and\\r\\ntaken the place of the incandescent rocks of the primitive period.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Axel, there is a very simple answer to your objection that\\r\\nthis soil is alluvial.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! at such a depth below the surface of the earth?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No doubt; and there is a geological explanation of the fact. At a\\r\\ncertain period the earth consisted only of an elastic crust or bark,\\r\\nalternately acted on by forces from above or below, according to the\\r\\nlaws of attraction and gravitation. Probably there were subsidences\\r\\nof the outer crust, when a portion of the sedimentary deposits was\\r\\ncarried down sudden openings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That may be,\" I replied; \"but if there have been creatures now\\r\\nextinct in these underground regions, why may not some of those\\r\\nmonsters be now roaming through these gloomy forests, or hidden\\r\\nbehind the steep crags?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as this unpleasant notion got hold of me, I surveyed with anxious\\r\\nscrutiny the open spaces before me; but no living creature appeared\\r\\nupon the barren strand.\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt rather tired, and went to sit down at the end of a promontory,\\r\\nat the foot of which the waves came and beat themselves into spray.\\r\\nThence my eye could sweep every part of the bay; within its extremity\\r\\na little harbour was formed between the pyramidal cliffs, where the\\r\\nstill waters slept untouched by the boisterous winds. A brig and two\\r\\nor three schooners might have moored within it in safety. I almost\\r\\nfancied I should presently see some ship issue from it, full sail,\\r\\nand take to the open sea under the southern breeze.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this illusion lasted a very short time. We were the only living\\r\\ncreatures in this subterranean world. When the wind lulled, a deeper\\r\\nsilence than that of the deserts fell upon the arid, naked rocks, and\\r\\nweighed upon the surface of the ocean. I then desired to pierce the\\r\\ndistant haze, and to rend asunder the mysterious curtain that hung\\r\\nacross the horizon. Anxious queries arose to my lips. Where did that\\r\\nsea terminate? Where did it lead to? Should we ever know anything\\r\\nabout its opposite shores?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle made no doubt about it at all; I both desired and feared.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter spending an hour in the contemplation of this marvellous\\r\\nspectacle, we returned to the shore to regain the grotto, and I fell\\r\\nasleep in the midst of the strangest thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXI.\\r\\n\\r\\nPREPARATIONS FOR A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning I awoke feeling perfectly well. I thought a bathe\\r\\nwould do me good, and I went to plunge for a few minutes into the\\r\\nwaters of this mediterranean sea, for assuredly it better deserved\\r\\nthis name than any other sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nI came back to breakfast with a good appetite. Hans was a good\\r\\ncaterer for our little household; he had water and fire at his\\r\\ndisposal, so that he was able to vary our bill of fare now and then.\\r\\nFor dessert he gave us a few cups of coffee, and never was coffee so\\r\\ndelicious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said my uncle, \"now is the time for high tide, and we must not\\r\\nlose the opportunity to study this phenomenon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! the tide!\" I cried. \"Can the influence of the sun and moon be\\r\\nfelt down here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not? Are not all bodies subject throughout their mass to the\\r\\npower of universal attraction? This mass of water cannot escape the\\r\\ngeneral law. And in spite of the heavy atmospheric pressure on the\\r\\nsurface, you will see it rise like the Atlantic itself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same moment we reached the sand on the shore, and the waves\\r\\nwere by slow degrees encroaching on the shore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is the tide rising,\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Axel; and judging by these ridges of foam, you may observe that\\r\\nthe sea will rise about twelve feet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is wonderful,\" I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; it is quite natural.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may say so, uncle; but to me it is most extraordinary, and I can\\r\\nhardly believe my eyes. Who would ever have imagined, under this\\r\\nterrestrial crust, an ocean with ebbing and flowing tides, with winds\\r\\nand storms?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" replied my uncle, \"is there any scientific reason against it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; I see none, as soon as the theory of central heat is given up.\"\\r\\n\"So then, thus far,\" he answered, \"the theory of Sir Humphry Davy is\\r\\nconfirmed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Evidently it is; and now there is no reason why there should not be\\r\\nseas and continents in the interior of the earth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No doubt,\" said my uncle; \"and inhabited too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure,\" said I; \"and why should not these waters yield to us\\r\\nfishes of unknown species?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At any rate,\" he replied, \"we have not seen any yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, let us make some lines, and see if the bait will draw here as\\r\\nit does in sublunary regions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will try, Axel, for we must penetrate all secrets of these newly\\r\\ndiscovered regions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But where are we, uncle? for I have not yet asked you that question,\\r\\nand your instruments must be able to furnish the answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Horizontally, three hundred and fifty leagues from Iceland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much as that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure of not being a mile out of my reckoning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And does the compass still show south-east?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; with a westerly deviation of nineteen degrees forty-five\\r\\nminutes, just as above ground. As for its dip, a curious fact is\\r\\ncoming to light, which I have observed carefully: that the needle,\\r\\ninstead of dipping towards the pole as in the northern hemisphere, on\\r\\nthe contrary, rises from it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you then conclude,\" I said, \"that the magnetic pole is\\r\\nsomewhere between the surface of the globe and the point where we\\r\\nare?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly so; and it is likely enough that if we were to reach the\\r\\nspot beneath the polar regions, about that seventy-first degree where\\r\\nSir James Ross has discovered the magnetic pole to be situated, we\\r\\nshould see the needle point straight up. Therefore that mysterious\\r\\ncentre of attraction is at no great depth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI remarked: \"It is so; and here is a fact which science has scarcely\\r\\nsuspected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Science, my lad, has been built upon many errors; but they are\\r\\nerrors which it was good to fall into, for they led to the truth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What depth have we now reached?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are thirty-five leagues below the surface.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So,\" I said, examining the map, \"the Highlands of Scotland are over\\r\\nour heads, and the Grampians are raising their rugged summits above\\r\\nus.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" answered the Professor laughing. \"It is rather a heavy weight\\r\\nto bear, but a solid arch spans over our heads. The great Architect\\r\\nhas built it of the best materials; and never could man have given it\\r\\nso wide a stretch. What are the finest arches of bridges and the\\r\\narcades of cathedrals, compared with this far reaching vault, with a\\r\\nradius of three leagues, beneath which a wide and tempest-tossed\\r\\nocean may flow at its ease?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I am not afraid that it will fall down upon my head. But now\\r\\nwhat are your plans? Are you not thinking of returning to the surface\\r\\nnow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Return! no, indeed! We will continue our journey, everything having\\r\\ngone on well so far.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how are we to get down below this liquid surface?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I am not going to dive head foremost. But if all oceans are\\r\\nproperly speaking but lakes, since they are encompassed by land, of\\r\\ncourse this internal sea will be surrounded by a coast of granite,\\r\\nand on the opposite shores we shall find fresh passages opening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How long do you suppose this sea to be?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thirty or forty leagues; so that we have no time to lose, and we\\r\\nshall set sail to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked about for a ship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Set sail, shall we? But I should like to see my boat first.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will not be a boat at all, but a good, well-made raft.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" I said, \"a raft would be just as hard to make as a boat, and I\\r\\ndon\\'t see--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know you don\\'t see; but you might hear if you would listen. Don\\'t\\r\\nyou hear the hammer at work? Hans is already busy at it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, has he already felled the trees?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, the trees were already down. Come, and you will see for\\r\\nyourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter half an hour\\'s walking, on the other side of the promontory\\r\\nwhich formed the little natural harbour, I perceived Hans at work. In\\r\\na few more steps I was at his side. To my great surprise a\\r\\nhalf-finished raft was already lying on the sand, made of a peculiar\\r\\nkind of wood, and a great number of planks, straight and bent, and of\\r\\nframes, were covering the ground, enough almost for a little fleet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Uncle, what wood is this?\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is fir, pine, or birch, and other northern coniferae, mineralised\\r\\nby the action of the sea. It is called surturbrand, a variety of\\r\\nbrown coal or lignite, found chiefly in Iceland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But surely, then, like other fossil wood, it must be as hard as\\r\\nstone, and cannot float?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sometimes that may happen; some of these woods become true\\r\\nanthracites; but others, such as this, have only gone through the\\r\\nfirst stage of fossil transformation. Just look,\" added my uncle,\\r\\nthrowing into the sea one of those precious waifs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bit of wood, after disappearing, returned to the surface and\\r\\noscillated to and fro with the waves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you convinced?\" said my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am quite convinced, although it is incredible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy next evening, thanks to the industry and skill of our guide, the\\r\\nraft was made. It was ten feet by five; the planks of surturbrand,\\r\\nbraced strongly together with cords, presented an even surface, and\\r\\nwhen launched this improvised vessel floated easily upon the waves of\\r\\nthe Liedenbrock Sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXII.\\r\\n\\r\\nWONDERS OF THE DEEP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 13th of August we awoke early. We were now to begin to adopt a\\r\\nmode of travelling both more expeditious and less fatiguing than\\r\\nhitherto.\\r\\n\\r\\nA mast was made of two poles spliced together, a yard was made of a\\r\\nthird, a blanket borrowed from our coverings made a tolerable sail.\\r\\nThere was no want of cordage for the rigging, and everything was well\\r\\nand firmly made.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe provisions, the baggage, the instruments, the guns, and a good\\r\\nquantity of fresh water from the rocks around, all found their proper\\r\\nplaces on board; and at six the Professor gave the signal to embark.\\r\\nHans had fitted up a rudder to steer his vessel. He took the tiller,\\r\\nand unmoored; the sail was set, and we were soon afloat. At the\\r\\nmoment of leaving the harbour, my uncle, who was tenaciously fond of\\r\\nnaming his new discoveries, wanted to give it a name, and proposed\\r\\nmine amongst others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I have a better to propose,\" I said: \"Grauben. Let it be called\\r\\nPort Graeuben; it will look very well upon the map.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Port Graeuben let it be then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so the cherished remembrance of my Virlandaise became associated\\r\\nwith our adventurous expedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wind was from the north-west. We went with it at a high rate of\\r\\nspeed. The dense atmosphere acted with great force and impelled us\\r\\nswiftly on.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an hour my uncle had been able to estimate our progress. At this\\r\\nrate, he said, we shall make thirty leagues in twenty-four hours, and\\r\\nwe shall soon come in sight of the opposite shore.\\r\\n\\r\\nI made no answer, but went and sat forward. The northern shore was\\r\\nalready beginning to dip under the horizon. The eastern and western\\r\\nstrands spread wide as if to bid us farewell. Before our eyes lay far\\r\\nand wide a vast sea; shadows of great clouds swept heavily over its\\r\\nsilver-grey surface; the glistening bluish rays of electric light,\\r\\nhere and there reflected by the dancing drops of spray, shot out\\r\\nlittle sheaves of light from the track we left in our rear. Soon we\\r\\nentirely lost sight of land; no object was left for the eye to judge\\r\\nby, and but for the frothy track of the raft, I might have thought we\\r\\nwere standing still.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout twelve, immense shoals of seaweeds came in sight. I was aware\\r\\nof the great powers of vegetation that characterise these plants,\\r\\nwhich grow at a depth of twelve thousand feet, reproduce themselves\\r\\nunder a pressure of four hundred atmospheres, and sometimes form\\r\\nbarriers strong enough to impede the course of a ship. But never, I\\r\\nthink, were such seaweeds as those which we saw floating in immense\\r\\nwaving lines upon the sea of Liedenbrock.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur raft skirted the whole length of the fuci, three or four thousand\\r\\nfeet long, undulating like vast serpents beyond the reach of sight; I\\r\\nfound some amusement in tracing these endless waves, always thinking\\r\\nI should come to the end of them, and for hours my patience was vying\\r\\nwith my surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat natural force could have produced such plants, and what must\\r\\nhave been the appearance of the earth in the first ages of its\\r\\nformation, when, under the action of heat and moisture, the vegetable\\r\\nkingdom alone was developing on its surface?\\r\\n\\r\\nEvening came, and, as on the previous day, I perceived no change in\\r\\nthe luminous condition of the air. It was a constant condition, the\\r\\npermanency of which might be relied upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter supper I laid myself down at the foot of the mast, and fell\\r\\nasleep in the midst of fantastic reveries.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans, keeping fast by the helm, let the raft run on, which, after\\r\\nall, needed no steering, the wind blowing directly aft.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince our departure from Port Graeuben, Professor Liedenbrock had\\r\\nentrusted the log to my care; I was to register every observation,\\r\\nmake entries of interesting phenomena, the direction of the wind, the\\r\\nrate of sailing, the way we made--in a word, every particular of our\\r\\nsingular voyage.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall therefore reproduce here these daily notes, written, so to\\r\\nspeak, as the course of events directed, in order to furnish an exact\\r\\nnarrative of our passage.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Friday, August 14_.--Wind steady, N.W. The raft makes rapid way in\\r\\na direct line. Coast thirty leagues to leeward. Nothing in sight\\r\\nbefore us. Intensity of light the same. Weather fine; that is to say,\\r\\nthat the clouds are flying high, are light, and bathed in a white\\r\\natmosphere resembling silver in a state of fusion. Therm. 89 deg. Fahr.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt noon Hans prepared a hook at the end of a line. He baited it with\\r\\na small piece of meat and flung it into the sea. For two hours\\r\\nnothing was caught. Are these waters, then, bare of inhabitants? No,\\r\\nthere\\'s a pull at the line. Hans draws it in and brings out a\\r\\nstruggling fish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A sturgeon,\" I cried; \"a small sturgeon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Professor eyes the creature attentively, and his opinion differs\\r\\nfrom mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe head of this fish was flat, but rounded in front, and the\\r\\nanterior part of its body was plated with bony, angular scales; it\\r\\nhad no teeth, its pectoral fins were large, and of tail there was\\r\\nnone. The animal belonged to the same order as the sturgeon, but\\r\\ndiffered from that fish in many essential particulars. After a short\\r\\nexamination my uncle pronounced his opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This fish belongs to an extinct family, of which only fossil traces\\r\\nare found in the devonian formations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What!\" I cried. \"Have we taken alive an inhabitant of the seas of\\r\\nprimitive ages?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; and you will observe that these fossil fishes have no identity\\r\\nwith any living species. To have in one\\'s possession a living\\r\\nspecimen is a happy event for a naturalist.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But to what family does it belong?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is of the order of ganoids, of the family of the cephalaspidae;\\r\\nand a species of pterichthys. But this one displays a peculiarity\\r\\nconfined to all fishes that inhabit subterranean waters. It is blind,\\r\\nand not only blind, but actually has no eyes at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked: nothing could be more certain. But supposing it might be a\\r\\nsolitary case, we baited afresh, and threw out our line. Surely this\\r\\nocean is well peopled with fish, for in another couple of hours we\\r\\ntook a large quantity of pterichthydes, as well as of others\\r\\nbelonging to the extinct family of the dipterides, but of which my\\r\\nuncle could not tell the species; none had organs of sight. This\\r\\nunhoped-for catch recruited our stock of provisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus it is evident that this sea contains none but species known to\\r\\nus in their fossil state, in which fishes as well as reptiles are the\\r\\nless perfectly and completely organised the farther back their date\\r\\nof creation.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps we may yet meet with some of those saurians which science has\\r\\nreconstructed out of a bit of bone or cartilage. I took up the\\r\\ntelescope and scanned the whole horizon, and found it everywhere a\\r\\ndesert sea. We are far away removed from the shores.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gaze upward in the air. Why should not some of the strange birds\\r\\nrestored by the immortal Cuvier again flap their \\'sail-broad vans\\' in\\r\\nthis dense and heavy atmosphere? There are sufficient fish for their\\r\\nsupport. I survey the whole space that stretches overhead; it is as\\r\\ndesert as the shore was.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill my imagination carried me away amongst the wonderful\\r\\nspeculations of palaeontology. Though awake I fell into a dream. I\\r\\nthought I could see floating on the surface of the waters enormous\\r\\nchelonia, pre-adamite tortoises, resembling floating islands. Over the\\r\\ndimly lighted strand there trod the huge mammals of the first ages of\\r\\nthe world, the leptotherium (slender beast), found in the caverns of\\r\\nBrazil; the merycotherium (ruminating beast), found in the \\'drift\\' of\\r\\niceclad Siberia. Farther on, the pachydermatous lophiodon (crested\\r\\ntoothed), a gigantic tapir, hides behind the rocks to dispute its\\r\\nprey with the anoplotherium (unarmed beast), a strange creature,\\r\\nwhich seemed a compound of horse, rhinoceros, camel, and\\r\\nhippopotamus. The colossal mastodon (nipple-toothed) twists and\\r\\nuntwists his trunk, and brays and pounds with his huge tusks the\\r\\nfragments of rock that cover the shore; whilst the megatherium (huge\\r\\nbeast), buttressed upon his enormous hinder paws, grubs in the soil,\\r\\nawaking the sonorous echoes of the granite rocks with his tremendous\\r\\nroarings. Higher up, the protopitheca--the first monkey that\\r\\nappeared on the globe--is climbing up the steep ascents. Higher yet,\\r\\nthe pterodactyle (wing-fingered) darts in irregular zigzags to and\\r\\nfro in the heavy air. In the uppermost regions of the air immense\\r\\nbirds, more powerful than the cassowary, and larger than the ostrich,\\r\\nspread their vast breadth of wings and strike with their heads the\\r\\ngranite vault that bounds the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this fossil world rises to life again in my vivid imagination. I\\r\\nreturn to the scriptural periods or ages of the world, conventionally\\r\\ncalled \\'days,\\' long before the appearance of man, when the unfinished\\r\\nworld was as yet unfitted for his support. Then my dream backed even\\r\\nfarther still into the ages before the creation of living beings. The\\r\\nmammals disappear, then the birds vanish, then the reptiles of the\\r\\nsecondary period, and finally the fish, the crustaceans, molluscs,\\r\\nand articulated beings. Then the zoophytes of the transition period\\r\\nalso return to nothing. I am the only living thing in the world: all\\r\\nlife is concentrated in my beating heart alone. There are no more\\r\\nseasons; climates are no more; the heat of the globe continually\\r\\nincreases and neutralises that of the sun. Vegetation becomes\\r\\naccelerated. I glide like a shade amongst arborescent ferns, treading\\r\\nwith unsteady feet the coloured marls and the particoloured clays; I\\r\\nlean for support against the trunks of immense conifers; I lie in the\\r\\nshade of sphenophylla (wedge-leaved), asterophylla (star-leaved), and\\r\\nlycopods, a hundred feet high.\\r\\n\\r\\nAges seem no more than days! I am passed, against my will, in\\r\\nretrograde order, through the long series of terrestrial changes.\\r\\nPlants disappear; granite rocks soften; intense heat converts solid\\r\\nbodies into thick fluids; the waters again cover the face of the\\r\\nearth; they boil, they rise in whirling eddies of steam; white and\\r\\nghastly mists wrap round the shifting forms of the earth, which by\\r\\nimperceptible degrees dissolves into a gaseous mass, glowing fiery\\r\\nred and white, as large and as shining as the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I myself am floating with wild caprice in the midst of this\\r\\nnebulous mass of fourteen hundred thousand times the volume of the\\r\\nearth into which it will one day be condensed, and carried forward\\r\\namongst the planetary bodies. My body is no longer firm and\\r\\nterrestrial; it is resolved into its constituent atoms, subtilised,\\r\\nvolatilised. Sublimed into imponderable vapour, I mingle and am lost\\r\\nin the endless foods of those vast globular volumes of vaporous\\r\\nmists, which roll upon their flaming orbits through infinite space.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut is it not a dream? Whither is it carrying me? My feverish hand\\r\\nhas vainly attempted to describe upon paper its strange and wonderful\\r\\ndetails. I have forgotten everything that surrounds me. The\\r\\nProfessor, the guide, the raft--are all gone out of my ken. An\\r\\nillusion has laid hold upon me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter?\" my uncle breaks in.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy staring eyes are fixed vacantly upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take care, Axel, or you will fall overboard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment I felt the sinewy hand of Hans seizing me vigorously.\\r\\nBut for him, carried away by my dream, I should have thrown myself\\r\\ninto the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is he mad?\" cried the Professor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it all about?\" at last I cried, returning to myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you feel ill?\" my uncle asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; but I have had a strange hallucination; it is over now. Is all\\r\\ngoing on right?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it is a fair wind and a fine sea; we are sailing rapidly along,\\r\\nand if I am not out in my reckoning, we shall soon land.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt these words I rose and gazed round upon the horizon, still\\r\\neverywhere bounded by clouds alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nA BATTLE OF MONSTERS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_Saturday, August 15_.--The sea unbroken all round. No land in\\r\\nsight. The horizon seems extremely distant.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy head is still stupefied with the vivid reality of my dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle has had no dreams, but he is out of temper. He examines the\\r\\nhorizon all round with his glass, and folds his arms with the air of\\r\\nan injured man.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remark that Professor Liedenbrock has a tendency to relapse into an\\r\\nimpatient mood, and I make a note of it in my log. All my danger and\\r\\nsufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of\\r\\nhim; but now that I am well his nature has resumed its sway. And yet,\\r\\nwhat cause was there for anger? Is not the voyage prospering as\\r\\nfavourably as possible under the circumstances? Is not the raft\\r\\nspinning along with marvellous speed?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"-You seem anxious, my uncle,\" I said, seeing him continually with\\r\\nhis glass to his eye.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anxious! No, not at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Impatient, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One might be, with less reason than now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet we are going very fast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does that signify? I am not complaining that the rate is slow,\\r\\nbut that the sea is so wide.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI then remembered that the Professor, before starting, had estimated\\r\\nthe length of this underground sea at thirty leagues. Now we had made\\r\\nthree times the distance, yet still the southern coast was not in\\r\\nsight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are not descending as we ought to be,\" the Professor declares.\\r\\n\"We are losing time, and the fact is, I have not come all this way to\\r\\ntake a little sail upon a pond on a raft.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe called this sea a pond, and our long voyage, taking a little sail!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" I remarked, \"since we have followed the road that Saknussemm\\r\\nhas shown us--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is just the question. Have we followed that road? Did\\r\\nSaknussemm meet this sheet of water? Did he cross it? Has not the\\r\\nstream that we followed led us altogether astray?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At any rate we cannot feel sorry to have come so far. This prospect\\r\\nis magnificent, and--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I don\\'t care for prospects. I came with an object, and I mean to\\r\\nattain it. Therefore don\\'t talk to me about views and prospects.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI take this as my answer, and I leave the Professor to bite his lips\\r\\nwith impatience. At six in the evening Hans asks for his wages, and\\r\\nhis three rix dollars are counted out to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Sunday, August 16. _--Nothing new. Weather unchanged. The wind\\r\\nfreshens. On awaking, my first thought was to observe the intensity\\r\\nof the light. I was possessed with an apprehension lest the electric\\r\\nlight should grow dim, or fail altogether. But there seemed no reason\\r\\nto fear. The shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface\\r\\nof the waves.\\r\\n\\r\\nTruly this sea is of infinite width. It must be as wide as the\\r\\nMediterranean or the Atlantic--and why not?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle took soundings several times. He tied the heaviest of our\\r\\npickaxes to a long rope which he let down two hundred fathoms. No\\r\\nbottom yet; and we had some difficulty in hauling up our plummet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the pick was shipped again, Hans pointed out on its surface\\r\\ndeep prints as if it had been violently compressed between two hard\\r\\nbodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at the hunter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Taender,_\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not understand him, and turned to my uncle who was entirely\\r\\nabsorbed in his calculations. I had rather not disturb him while he\\r\\nis quiet. I return to the Icelander. He by a snapping motion of his\\r\\njaws conveys his ideas to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Teeth!\" I cried, considering the iron bar with more attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, indeed, those are the marks of teeth imprinted upon the metal!\\r\\nThe jaws which they arm must be possessed of amazing strength. Is\\r\\nthere some monster beneath us belonging to the extinct races, more\\r\\nvoracious than the shark, more fearful in vastness than the whale? I\\r\\ncould not take my eyes off this indented iron bar. Surely will my\\r\\nlast night\\'s dream be realised?\\r\\n\\r\\nThese thoughts agitated me all day, and my imagination scarcely\\r\\ncalmed down after several hours\\' sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Monday, August 17.--_ I am trying to recall the peculiar instincts\\r\\nof the monsters of the pre-adamite world, who, coming next in\\r\\nsuccession after the molluscs, the crustaceans and le fishes,\\r\\npreceded the animals of mammalian race upon the earth. The world then\\r\\nbelonged to reptiles. Those monsters held the mastery in the seas of\\r\\nthe secondary period. They possessed a perfect organisation, gigantic\\r\\nproportions, prodigious strength. The saurians of our day, the\\r\\nalligators and the crocodiles, are but feeble reproductions of their\\r\\nforefathers of primitive ages.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shudder as I recall these monsters to my remembrance. No human eye\\r\\nhas ever beheld them living. They burdened this earth a thousand ages\\r\\nbefore man appeared, but their fossil remains, found in the\\r\\nargillaceous limestone called by the English the lias, have enabled\\r\\ntheir colossal structure to be perfectly built up again and\\r\\nanatomically ascertained.\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw at the Hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures\\r\\nthirty feet in length. Am I then fated--I, a denizen of earth--to\\r\\nbe placed face to face with these representatives of long extinct\\r\\nfamilies? No; surely it cannot be! Yet the deep marks of conical\\r\\nteeth upon the iron pick are certainly those of the crocodile.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy eyes are fearfully bent upon the sea. I dread to see one of these\\r\\nmonsters darting forth from its submarine caverns. I suppose\\r\\nProfessor Liedenbrock was of my opinion too, and even shared my\\r\\nfears, for after having examined the pick, his eyes traversed the\\r\\nocean from side to side. What a very bad notion that was of his, I\\r\\nthought to myself, to take soundings just here! He has disturbed some\\r\\nmonstrous beast in its remote den, and if we are not attacked on our\\r\\nvoyage--\\r\\n\\r\\nI look at our guns and see that they are all right. My uncle notices\\r\\nit, and looks on approvingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready widely disturbed regions on the surface of the water indicate\\r\\nsome commotion below. The danger is approaching. We must be on the\\r\\nlook out.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Tuesday, August 18. _--Evening came, or rather the time came when\\r\\nsleep weighs down the weary eyelids, for there is no night here, and\\r\\nthe ceaseless light wearies the eyes with its persistency just as if\\r\\nwe were sailing under an arctic sun. Hans was at the helm. During his\\r\\nwatch I slept.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me. The raft was heaved\\r\\nup on a watery mountain and pitched down again, at a distance of\\r\\ntwenty fathoms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter?\" shouted my uncle. \"Have we struck land?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHans pointed with his finger at a dark mass six hundred yards away,\\r\\nrising and falling alternately with heavy plunges. I looked and cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is an enormous porpoise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied my uncle, \"and there is a sea lizard of vast size.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And farther on a monstrous crocodile. Look at its vast jaws and its\\r\\nrows of teeth! It is diving down!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s a whale, a whale!\" cried the Professor. \"I can see its great\\r\\nfins. See how he is throwing out air and water through his blowers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in fact two liquid columns were rising to a considerable height\\r\\nabove the sea. We stood amazed, thunderstruck, at the presence of\\r\\nsuch a herd of marine monsters. They were of supernatural dimensions;\\r\\nthe smallest of them would have crunched our raft, crew and all, at\\r\\none snap of its huge jaws.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans wants to tack to get away from this dangerous neighbourhood; but\\r\\nhe sees on the other hand enemies not less terrible; a tortoise forty\\r\\nfeet long, and a serpent of thirty, lifting its fearful head and\\r\\ngleaming eyes above the flood.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlight was out of the question now. The reptiles rose; they wheeled\\r\\naround our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express\\r\\ntrains. They described around us gradually narrowing circles. I took\\r\\nup my rifle. But what could a ball do against the scaly armour with\\r\\nwhich these enormous beasts were clad?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stood dumb with fear. They approach us close: on one side the\\r\\ncrocodile, on the other the serpent. The remainder of the sea\\r\\nmonsters have disappeared. I prepare to fire. Hans stops me by a\\r\\ngesture. The two monsters pass within a hundred and fifty yards of\\r\\nthe raft, and hurl themselves the one upon the other, with a fury\\r\\nwhich prevents them from seeing us.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt three hundred yards from us the battle was fought. We could\\r\\ndistinctly observe the two monsters engaged in deadly conflict. But\\r\\nit now seems to me as if the other animals were taking part in the\\r\\nfray--the porpoise, the whale, the lizard, the tortoise. Every\\r\\nmoment I seem to see one or other of them. I point them to the\\r\\nIcelander. He shakes his head negatively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Tva,_\" says he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What two? Does he mean that there are only two animals?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is right,\" said my uncle, whose glass has never left his eye.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surely you must be mistaken,\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No: the first of those monsters has a porpoise\\'s snout, a lizard\\'s\\r\\nhead, a crocodile\\'s teeth; and hence our mistake. It is the\\r\\nichthyosaurus (the fish lizard), the most terrible of the ancient\\r\\nmonsters of the deep.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the other?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The other is a plesiosaurus (almost lizard), a serpent, armoured\\r\\nwith the carapace and the paddles of a turtle; he is the dreadful\\r\\nenemy of the other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHans had spoken truly. Two monsters only were creating all this\\r\\ncommotion; and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive\\r\\nworld. I can distinguish the eye of the ichthyosaurus glowing like a\\r\\nred-hot coal, and as large as a man\\'s head. Nature has endowed it\\r\\nwith an optical apparatus of extreme power, and capable of resisting\\r\\nthe pressure of the great volume of water in the depths it inhabits.\\r\\nIt has been appropriately called the saurian whale, for it has both\\r\\nthe swiftness and the rapid movements of this monster of our own day.\\r\\nThis one is not less than a hundred feet long, and I can judge of its\\r\\nsize when it sweeps over the waters the vertical coils of its tail.\\r\\nIts jaw is enormous, and according to naturalists it is armed with no\\r\\nless than one hundred and eighty-two teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plesiosaurus, a serpent with a cylindrical body and a short tail,\\r\\nhas four flappers or paddles to act like oars. Its body is entirely\\r\\ncovered with a thick armour of scales, and its neck, as flexible as a\\r\\nswan\\'s, rises thirty feet above the waves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose huge creatures attacked each other with the greatest animosity.\\r\\nThey heaved around them liquid mountains, which rolled even to our\\r\\nraft and rocked it perilously. Twenty times we were near capsizing.\\r\\nHissings of prodigious force are heard. The two beasts are fast\\r\\nlocked together; I cannot distinguish the one from the other. The\\r\\nprobable rage of the conqueror inspires us with intense fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne hour, two hours, pass away. The struggle continues with unabated\\r\\nferocity. The combatants alternately approach and recede from our\\r\\nraft. We remain motionless, ready to fire. Suddenly the ichthyosaurus\\r\\nand the plesiosaurus disappear below, leaving a whirlpool eddying in\\r\\nthe water. Several minutes pass by while the fight goes on under\\r\\nwater.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll at once an enormous head is darted up, the head of the\\r\\nplesiosaurus. The monster is wounded to death. I no longer see his\\r\\nscaly armour. Only his long neck shoots up, drops again, coils and\\r\\nuncoils, droops, lashes the waters like a gigantic whip, and writhes\\r\\nlike a worm that you tread on. The water is splashed for a long way\\r\\naround. The spray almost blinds us. But soon the reptile\\'s agony\\r\\ndraws to an end; its movements become fainter, its contortions cease\\r\\nto be so violent, and the long serpentine form lies a lifeless log on\\r\\nthe labouring deep.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the ichthyosaurus--has he returned to his submarine cavern?\\r\\nor will he reappear on the surface of the sea?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GREAT GEYSER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_Wednesday, August 19_.--Fortunately the wind blows violently, and\\r\\nhas enabled us to flee from the scene of the late terrible struggle.\\r\\nHans keeps at his post at the helm. My uncle, whom the absorbing\\r\\nincidents of the combat had drawn away from his contemplations, began\\r\\nagain to look impatiently around him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voyage resumes its uniform tenor, which I don\\'t care to break\\r\\nwith a repetition of such events as yesterday\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThursday, Aug. 20.--Wind N.N.E., unsteady and fitful. Temperature\\r\\nhigh. Rate three and a half leagues an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout noon a distant noise is heard. I note the fact without being\\r\\nable to explain it. It is a continuous roar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the distance,\" says the Professor, \"there is a rock or islet,\\r\\nagainst which the sea is breaking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHans climbs up the mast, but sees no breakers. The ocean\\' is smooth\\r\\nand unbroken to its farthest limit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree hours pass away. The roarings seem to proceed from a very\\r\\ndistant waterfall.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remark upon this to my uncle, who replies doubtfully: \"Yes, I am\\r\\nconvinced that I am right.\" Are we, then, speeding forward to some\\r\\ncataract which will cast us down an abyss? This method of getting on\\r\\nmay please the Professor, because it is vertical; but for my part I\\r\\nprefer the more ordinary modes of horizontal progression.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt any rate, some leagues to the windward there must be some noisy\\r\\nphenomenon, for now the roarings are heard with increasing loudness.\\r\\nDo they proceed from the sky or the ocean?\\r\\n\\r\\nI look up to the atmospheric vapours, and try to fathom their depths.\\r\\nThe sky is calm and motionless. The clouds have reached the utmost\\r\\nlimit of the lofty vault, and there lie still bathed in the bright\\r\\nglare of the electric light. It is not there that we must seek for\\r\\nthe cause of this phenomenon. Then I examine the horizon, which is\\r\\nunbroken and clear of all mist. There is no change in its aspect. But\\r\\nif this noise arises from a fall, a cataract, if all this ocean flows\\r\\naway headlong into a lower basin yet, if that deafening roar is\\r\\nproduced by a mass of falling water, the current must needs\\r\\naccelerate, and its increasing speed will give me the measure of the\\r\\nperil that threatens us. I consult the current: there is none. I\\r\\nthrow an empty bottle into the sea: it lies still.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout four Hans rises, lays hold of the mast, climbs to its top.\\r\\nThence his eye sweeps a large area of sea, and it is fixed upon a\\r\\npoint. His countenance exhibits no surprise, but his eye is immovably\\r\\nsteady.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He sees something,\" says my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe he does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHans comes down, then stretches his arm to the south, saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Dere nere!_\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Down there?\" repeated my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, seizing his glass, he gazes attentively for a minute, which\\r\\nseems to me an age.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes!\" he cried. \"I see a vast inverted cone rising from the\\r\\nsurface.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it another sea beast?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then let us steer farther westward, for we know something of the\\r\\ndanger of coming across monsters of that sort.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us go straight on,\" replied my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\nI appealed to Hans. He maintained his course inflexibly.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, if at our present distance from the animal, a distance of twelve\\r\\nleagues at the least, the column of water driven through its blowers\\r\\nmay be distinctly seen, it must needs be of vast size. The commonest\\r\\nprudence would counsel immediate flight; but we did not come so far\\r\\nto be prudent.\\r\\n\\r\\nImprudently, therefore, we pursue our way. The nearer we approach,\\r\\nthe higher mounts the jet of water. What monster can possibly fill\\r\\nitself with such a quantity of water, and spurt it up so continuously?\\r\\n\\r\\nAt eight in the evening we are not two leagues distant from it. Its\\r\\nbody--dusky, enormous, hillocky--lies spread upon the sea like an\\r\\nislet. Is it illusion or fear? Its length seems to me a couple of\\r\\nthousand yards. What can be this cetacean, which neither Cuvier nor\\r\\nBlumenbach knew anything about? It lies motionless, as if asleep; the\\r\\nsea seems unable to move it in the least; it is the waves that\\r\\nundulate upon its sides. The column of water thrown up to a height of\\r\\nfive hundred feet falls in rain with a deafening uproar. And here are\\r\\nwe scudding like lunatics before the wind, to get near to a monster\\r\\nthat a hundred whales a day would not satisfy!\\r\\n\\r\\nTerror seizes upon me. I refuse to go further. I will cut the\\r\\nhalliards if necessary! I am in open mutiny against the Professor,\\r\\nwho vouchsafes no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Hans rises, and pointing with his finger at the menacing\\r\\nobject, he says:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Holm._\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An island!\" cries my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s not an island!\" I cried sceptically.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s nothing else,\" shouted the Professor, with a loud laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that column of water?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Geyser,_\" said Hans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No doubt it is a geyser, like those in Iceland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first I protest against being so widely mistaken as to have taken\\r\\nan island for a marine monster. But the evidence is against me, and I\\r\\nhave to confess my error. It is nothing worse than a natural\\r\\nphenomenon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we approach nearer the dimensions of the liquid column become\\r\\nmagnificent. The islet resembles, with a most deceiving likeness, an\\r\\nenormous cetacean, whose head dominates the waves at a height of\\r\\ntwenty yards. The geyser, a word meaning \\'fury,\\' rises majestically\\r\\nfrom its extremity. Deep and heavy explosions are heard from time to\\r\\ntime, when the enormous jet, possessed with more furious violence,\\r\\nshakes its plumy crest, and springs with a bound till it reaches the\\r\\nlowest stratum of the clouds. It stands alone. No steam vents, no hot\\r\\nsprings surround it, and all the volcanic power of the region is\\r\\nconcentrated here. Sparks of electric fire mingle with the dazzling\\r\\nsheaf of lighted fluid, every drop of which refracts the prismatic\\r\\ncolours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us land,\" said the Professor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But we must carefully avoid this waterspout, which would sink our\\r\\nraft in a moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHans, steering with his usual skill, brought us to the other\\r\\nextremity of the islet.\\r\\n\\r\\nI leaped up on the rock; my uncle lightly followed, while our hunter\\r\\nremained at his post, like a man too wise ever to be astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe walked upon granite mingled with siliceous tufa. The soil shivers\\r\\nand shakes under our feet, like the sides of an overheated boiler\\r\\nfilled with steam struggling to get loose. We come in sight of a\\r\\nsmall central basin, out of which the geyser springs. I plunge a\\r\\nregister thermometer into the boiling water. It marks an intense heat\\r\\nof 325 deg., which is far above the boiling point; therefore this water\\r\\nissues from an ardent furnace, which is not at all in harmony with\\r\\nProfessor Liedenbrock\\'s theories. I cannot help making the remark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" he replied, \"how does that make against my doctrine?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, nothing at all,\" I said, seeing that I was going in opposition\\r\\nto immovable obstinacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill I am constrained to confess that hitherto we have been\\r\\nwonderfully favoured, and that for some reason unknown to myself we\\r\\nhave accomplished our journey under singularly favourable conditions\\r\\nof temperature. But it seems manifest to me that some day we shall\\r\\nreach a region where the central heat attains its highest limits, and\\r\\ngoes beyond a point that can be registered by our thermometers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is what we shall see.\" So says the Professor, who, having named\\r\\nthis volcanic islet after his nephew, gives the signal to embark\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some minutes I am still contemplating the geyser. I notice that\\r\\nit throws up its column of water with variable force: sometimes\\r\\nsending it to a great height, then again to a lower, which I\\r\\nattribute to the variable pressure of the steam accumulated in its\\r\\nreservoir.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last we leave the island, rounding away past the low rocks on its\\r\\nsouthern shore. Hans has taken advantage of the halt to refit his\\r\\nrudder.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut before going any farther I make a few observations, to calculate\\r\\nthe distance we have gone over, and note them in my journal. We have\\r\\ncrossed two hundred and seventy leagues of sea since leaving Port\\r\\nGraeuben; and we are six hundred and twenty leagues from Iceland,\\r\\nunder England. [1]\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] This distance carries the travellers as far as under the Pyrenees\\r\\nif the league measures three miles. (Trans.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXV.\\r\\n\\r\\nAN ELECTRIC STORM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_Friday, August 21_.--On the morrow the magnificent geyser has\\r\\ndisappeared. The wind has risen, and has rapidly carried us away from\\r\\nAxel Island. The roarings become lost in the distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weather--if we may use that term--will change before long. The\\r\\natmosphere is charged with vapours, pervaded with the electricity\\r\\ngenerated by the evaporation of saline waters. The clouds are sinking\\r\\nlower, and assume an olive hue. The electric light can scarcely\\r\\npenetrate through the dense curtain which has dropped over the\\r\\ntheatre on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged.\\r\\n\\r\\nI feel peculiar sensations, like many creatures on earth at the\\r\\napproach of violent atmospheric changes. The heavily voluted cumulus\\r\\nclouds lower gloomily and threateningly; they wear that implacable\\r\\nlook which I have sometimes noticed at the outbreak of a great storm.\\r\\nThe air is heavy; the sea is calm.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the distance the clouds resemble great bales of cotton, piled up\\r\\nin picturesque disorder. By degrees they dilate, and gain in huge\\r\\nsize what they lose in number. Such is their ponderous weight that\\r\\nthey cannot rise from the horizon; but, obeying an impulse from\\r\\nhigher currents, their dense consistency slowly yields. The gloom\\r\\nupon them deepens; and they soon present to our view a ponderous mass\\r\\nof almost level surface. From time to time a fleecy tuft of mist,\\r\\nwith yet some gleaming light left upon it, drops down upon the dense\\r\\nfloor of grey, and loses itself in the opaque and impenetrable mass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe atmosphere is evidently charged and surcharged with electricity.\\r\\nMy whole body is saturated; my hair bristles just as when you stand\\r\\nupon an insulated stool under the action of an electrical machine. It\\r\\nseems to me as if my companions, the moment they touched me, would\\r\\nreceive a severe shock like that from an electric eel.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt ten in the morning the symptoms of storm become aggravated. The\\r\\nwind never lulls but to acquire increased strength; the vast bank of\\r\\nheavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing\\r\\nstorms.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am loth to believe these atmospheric menaces, and yet I cannot help\\r\\nmuttering:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here\\'s some very bad weather coming on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Professor made no answer. His temper is awful, to judge from the\\r\\nworking of his features, as he sees this vast length of ocean\\r\\nunrolling before him to an indefinite extent. He can only spare time\\r\\nto shrug his shoulders viciously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s a heavy storm coming on,\" I cried, pointing towards the\\r\\nhorizon. \"Those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA deep silence falls on all around. The lately roaring winds are\\r\\nhushed into a dead calm; nature seems to breathe no more, and to be\\r\\nsinking into the stillness of death. On the mast already I see the\\r\\nlight play of a lambent St. Elmo\\'s fire; the outstretched sail\\r\\ncatches not a breath of wind, and hangs like a sheet of lead. The\\r\\nrudder stands motionless in a sluggish, waveless sea. But if we have\\r\\nnow ceased to advance why do we yet leave that sail loose, which at\\r\\nthe first shock of the tempest may capsize us in a moment?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us reef the sail and cut the mast down!\" I cried. \"That will be\\r\\nsafest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no! Never!\" shouted my impetuous uncle. \"Never! Let the wind\\r\\ncatch us if it will! What I want is to get the least glimpse of rock\\r\\nor shore, even if our raft should be smashed into shivers!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth when a sudden change took\\r\\nplace in the southern sky. The piled-up vapours condense into water;\\r\\nand the air, put into violent action to supply the vacuum left by the\\r\\ncondensation of the mists, rouses itself into a whirlwind. It rushes\\r\\non from the farthest recesses of the vast cavern. The darkness\\r\\ndeepens; scarcely can I jot down a few hurried notes. The helm makes\\r\\na bound. My uncle falls full length; I creep close to him. He has\\r\\nlaid a firm hold upon a rope, and appears to watch with grim\\r\\nsatisfaction this awful display of elemental strife.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans stirs not. His long hair blown by the pelting storm, and laid\\r\\nflat across his immovable countenance, makes him a strange figure;\\r\\nfor the end of each lock of loose flowing hair is tipped with little\\r\\nluminous radiations. This frightful mask of electric sparks suggests\\r\\nto me, even in this dizzy excitement, a comparison with pre-adamite\\r\\nman, the contemporary of the ichthyosaurus and the megatherium. [1]\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] Rather of the mammoth and the mastodon. (Trans.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mast yet holds firm. The sail stretches tight like a bubble ready\\r\\nto burst. The raft flies at a rate that I cannot reckon, but not so\\r\\nfast as the foaming clouds of spray which it dashes from side to side\\r\\nin its headlong speed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The sail! the sail!\" I cry, motioning to lower it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No!\" replies my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Nej!_\" repeats Hans, leisurely shaking his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now the rain forms a rushing cataract in front of that horizon\\r\\ntoward which we are running with such maddening speed. But before it\\r\\nhas reached us the rain cloud parts asunder, the sea boils, and the\\r\\nelectric fires are brought into violent action by a mighty chemical\\r\\npower that descends from the higher regions. The most vivid flashes\\r\\nof lightning are mingled with the violent crash of continuous\\r\\nthunder. Ceaseless fiery arrows dart in and out amongst the flying\\r\\nthunder-clouds; the vaporous mass soon glows with incandescent heat;\\r\\nhailstones rattle fiercely down, and as they dash upon our iron tools\\r\\nthey too emit gleams and flashes of lurid light. The heaving waves\\r\\nresemble fiery volcanic hills, each belching forth its own interior\\r\\nflames, and every crest is plumed with dancing fire. My eyes fail\\r\\nunder the dazzling light, my ears are stunned with the incessant\\r\\ncrash of thunder. I must be bound to the mast, which bows like a reed\\r\\nbefore the mighty strength of the storm.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Here my notes become vague and indistinct. I have only been able to\\r\\nfind a few which I seem to have jotted down almost unconsciously. But\\r\\ntheir very brevity and their obscurity reveal the intensity of the\\r\\nexcitement which dominated me, and describe the actual position even\\r\\nbetter than my memory could do.)\\r\\n\\r\\nSunday, 23.--Where are we? Driven forward with a swiftness that\\r\\ncannot be measured.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night was fearful; no abatement of the storm. The din and uproar\\r\\nare incessant; our ears are bleeding; to exchange a word is\\r\\nimpossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lightning flashes with intense brilliancy, and never seems to\\r\\ncease for a moment. Zigzag streams of bluish white fire dash down\\r\\nupon the sea and rebound, and then take an upward flight till they\\r\\nstrike the granite vault that overarches our heads. Suppose that\\r\\nsolid roof should crumble down upon our heads! Other flashes with\\r\\nincessant play cross their vivid fires, while others again roll\\r\\nthemselves into balls of living fire which explode like bombshells,\\r\\nbut the music of which scarcely-adds to the din of the battle strife\\r\\nthat almost deprives us of our senses of hearing and sight; the limit\\r\\nof intense loudness has been passed within which the human ear can\\r\\ndistinguish one sound from another. If all the powder magazines in\\r\\nthe world were to explode at once, we should hear no more than we do\\r\\nnow.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the under surface of the clouds there are continual emissions of\\r\\nlurid light; electric matter is in continual evolution from their\\r\\ncomponent molecules; the gaseous elements of the air need to be\\r\\nslaked with moisture; for innumerable columns of water rush upwards\\r\\ninto the air and fall back again in white foam.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhither are we flying? My uncle lies full length across the raft.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heat increases. I refer to the thermometer; it indicates . . .\\r\\n(the figure is obliterated).\\r\\n\\r\\n_Monday, August 24._--Will there be an end to it? Is the atmospheric\\r\\ncondition, having once reached this density, to become final?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are prostrated and worn out with fatigue. But Hans is as usual.\\r\\nThe raft bears on still to the south-east. We have made two hundred\\r\\nleagues since we left Axel Island.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt noon the violence of the storm redoubles. We are obliged to secure\\r\\nas fast as possible every article that belongs to our cargo. Each of\\r\\nus is lashed to some part of the raft. The waves rise above our heads.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor three days we have never been able to make each other hear a\\r\\nword. Our mouths open, our lips move, but not a word can be heard. We\\r\\ncannot even make ourselves heard by approaching our mouth close to\\r\\nthe ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle has drawn nearer to me. He has uttered a few words. They\\r\\nseem to be \\'We are lost\\'; but I am not sure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last I write down the words: \"Let us lower the sail.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nods his consent.\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely has he lifted his head again before a ball of fire has\\r\\nbounded over the waves and lighted on board our raft. Mast and sail\\r\\nflew up in an instant together, and I saw them carried up to\\r\\nprodigious height, resembling in appearance a pterodactyle, one of\\r\\nthose strong birds of the infant world.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe lay there, our blood running cold with unspeakable terror. The\\r\\nfireball, half of it white, half azure blue, and the size of a\\r\\nten-inch shell, moved slowly about the raft, but revolving on its own\\r\\naxis with astonishing velocity, as if whipped round by the force of\\r\\nthe whirlwind. Here it comes, there it glides, now it is up the\\r\\nragged stump of the mast, thence it lightly leaps on the provision\\r\\nbag, descends with a light bound, and just skims the powder magazine.\\r\\nHorrible! we shall be blown up; but no, the dazzling disk of\\r\\nmysterious light nimbly leaps aside; it approaches Hans, who fixes\\r\\nhis blue eye upon it steadily; it threatens the head of my uncle, who\\r\\nfalls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it. And now my turn\\r\\ncomes; pale and trembling under the blinding splendour and the\\r\\nmelting heat, it drops at my feet, spinning silently round upon the\\r\\ndeck; I try to move my foot away, but cannot.\\r\\n\\r\\nA suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air, it enters the throat,\\r\\nit fills the lungs. We suffer stifling pains.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy am I unable to move my foot? Is it riveted to the planks? Alas!\\r\\nthe fall upon our fated raft of this electric globe has magnetised\\r\\nevery iron article on board. The instruments, the tools, our guns,\\r\\nare clashing and clanking violently in their collisions with each\\r\\nother; the nails of my boots cling tenaciously to a plate of iron let\\r\\ninto the timbers, and I cannot draw my foot away from the spot. At\\r\\nlast by a violent effort I release myself at the instant when the\\r\\nball in its gyrations was about to seize upon it, and carry me off my\\r\\nfeet ....\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! what a flood of intense and dazzling light! the globe has burst,\\r\\nand we are deluged with tongues of fire!\\r\\n\\r\\nThen all the light disappears. I could just see my uncle at full\\r\\nlength on the raft, and Hans still at his helm and spitting fire\\r\\nunder the action of the electricity which has saturated him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut where are we going to? Where?\\r\\n\\r\\n* * * *\\r\\n\\r\\n_Tuesday, August 25._--I recover from a long swoon. The storm\\r\\ncontinues to roar and rage; the lightnings dash hither and thither,\\r\\nlike broods of fiery serpents filling all the air. Are we still under\\r\\nthe sea? Yes, we are borne at incalculable speed. We have been\\r\\ncarried under England, under the channel, under France, perhaps under\\r\\nthe whole of Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * * *\\r\\n\\r\\nA fresh noise is heard! Surely it is the sea breaking upon the rocks!\\r\\nBut then . . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nCALM PHILOSOPHIC DISCUSSIONS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere I end what I may call my log, happily saved from the wreck, and\\r\\nI resume my narrative as before.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat happened when the raft was dashed upon the rocks is more than I\\r\\ncan tell. I felt myself hurled into the waves; and if I escaped from\\r\\ndeath, and if my body was not torn over the sharp edges of the rocks,\\r\\nit was because the powerful arm of Hans came to my rescue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brave Icelander carried me out of the reach of the waves, over a\\r\\nburning sand where I found myself by the side of my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he returned to the rocks, against which the furious waves were\\r\\nbeating, to save what he could. I was unable to speak. I was\\r\\nshattered with fatigue and excitement; I wanted a whole hour to\\r\\nrecover even a little.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a deluge of rain was still falling, though with that violence\\r\\nwhich generally denotes the near cessation of a storm. A few\\r\\noverhanging rocks afforded us some shelter from the storm. Hans\\r\\nprepared some food, which I could not touch; and each of us,\\r\\nexhausted with three sleepless nights, fell into a broken and painful\\r\\nsleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day the weather was splendid. The sky and the sea had sunk\\r\\ninto sudden repose. Every trace of the awful storm had disappeared.\\r\\nThe exhilarating voice of the Professor fell upon my ears as I awoke;\\r\\nhe was ominously cheerful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my boy,\" he cried, \"have you slept well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWould not any one have thought that we were still in our cheerful\\r\\nlittle house on the Koenigstrasse and that I was only just coming down\\r\\nto breakfast, and that I was to be married to Graeuben that day?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! if the tempest had but sent the raft a little more east, we\\r\\nshould have passed under Germany, under my beloved town of Hamburg,\\r\\nunder the very street where dwelt all that I loved most in the world.\\r\\nThen only forty leagues would have separated us! But they were forty\\r\\nleagues perpendicular of solid granite wall, and in reality we were a\\r\\nthousand leagues asunder!\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these painful reflections rapidly crossed my mind before I could\\r\\nanswer my uncle\\'s question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, now,\" he repeated, \"won\\'t you tell me how you have slept?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, very well,\" I said. \"I am only a little knocked up, but I shall\\r\\nsoon be better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" says my uncle, \"that\\'s nothing to signify. You are only a\\r\\nlittle bit tired.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you, uncle, you seem in very good spirits this morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Delighted, my boy, delighted. We have got there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To our journey\\'s end?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; but we have got to the end of that endless sea. Now we shall go\\r\\nby land, and really begin to go down! down! down!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear uncle, do let me ask you one question.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course, Axel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How about returning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Returning? Why, you are talking about the return before the arrival.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I only want to know how that is to be managed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the simplest way possible. When we have reached the centre of the\\r\\nglobe, either we shall find some new way to get back, or we shall\\r\\ncome back like decent folks the way we came. I feel pleased at the\\r\\nthought that it is sure not to be shut against us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But then we shall have to refit the raft.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, as to provisions, have we enough to last?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; to be sure we have. Hans is a clever fellow, and I am sure he\\r\\nmust have saved a large part of our cargo. But still let us go and\\r\\nmake sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe left this grotto which lay open to every wind. At the same time I\\r\\ncherished a trembling hope which was a fear as well. It seemed to me\\r\\nimpossible that the terrible wreck of the raft should not have\\r\\ndestroyed everything on board. On my arrival on the shore I found\\r\\nHans surrounded by an assemblage of articles all arranged in good\\r\\norder. My uncle shook hands with him with a lively gratitude. This\\r\\nman, with almost superhuman devotion, had been at work all the while\\r\\nthat we were asleep, and had saved the most precious of the articles\\r\\nat the risk of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot that we had suffered no losses. For instance, our firearms; but\\r\\nwe might do without them. Our stock of powder had remained uninjured\\r\\nafter having risked blowing up during the storm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" cried the Professor, \"as we have no guns we cannot hunt,\\r\\nthat\\'s all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but how about the instruments?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is the aneroid, the most useful of all, and for which I would\\r\\nhave given all the others. By means of it I can calculate the depth\\r\\nand know when we have reached the centre; without it we might very\\r\\nlikely go beyond, and come out at the antipodes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch high spirits as these were rather too strong.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But where is the compass? I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here it is, upon this rock, in perfect condition, as well as the\\r\\nthermometers and the chronometer. The hunter is a splendid fellow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no denying it. We had all our instruments. As for tools and\\r\\nappliances, there they all lay on the ground--ladders, ropes, picks,\\r\\nspades, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill there was the question of provisions to be settled, and I\\r\\nasked--\"How are we off for provisions?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boxes containing these were in a line upon the shore, in a\\r\\nperfect state of preservation; for the most part the sea had spared\\r\\nthem, and what with biscuits, salt meat, spirits, and salt fish, we\\r\\nmight reckon on four months\\' supply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Four months!\" cried the Professor. \"We have time to go and to\\r\\nreturn; and with what is left I will give a grand dinner to my\\r\\nfriends at the Johannaeum.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI ought by this time to have been quite accustomed to my uncle\\'s\\r\\nways; yet there was always something fresh about him to astonish me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said he, \"we will replenish our supply of water with the rain\\r\\nwhich the storm has left in all these granite basins; therefore we\\r\\nshall have no reason to fear anything from thirst. As for the raft, I\\r\\nwill recommend Hans to do his best to repair it, although I don\\'t\\r\\nexpect it will be of any further use to us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How so?\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An idea of my own, my lad. I don\\'t think we shall come out by the\\r\\nway that we went in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI stared at the Professor with a good deal of mistrust. I asked, was\\r\\nhe not touched in the brain? And yet there was method in his madness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now let us go to breakfast,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nI followed him to a headland, after he had given his instructions to\\r\\nthe hunter. There preserved meat, biscuit, and tea made us an\\r\\nexcellent meal, one of the best I ever remember. Hunger, the fresh\\r\\nair, the calm quiet weather, after the commotions we had gone\\r\\nthrough, all contributed to give me a good appetite.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst breakfasting I took the opportunity to put to my uncle the\\r\\nquestion where we were now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That seems to me,\" I said, \"rather difficult to make out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it is difficult,\" he said, \"to calculate exactly; perhaps even\\r\\nimpossible, since during these three stormy days I have been unable\\r\\nto keep any account of the rate or direction of the raft; but still\\r\\nwe may get an approximation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The last observation,\" I remarked, \"was made on the island, when the\\r\\ngeyser was--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean Axel Island. Don\\'t decline the honour of having given your\\r\\nname to the first island ever discovered in the central parts of the\\r\\nglobe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said I, \"let it be Axel Island. Then we had cleared two\\r\\nhundred and seventy leagues of sea, and we were six hundred leagues\\r\\nfrom Iceland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well,\" answered my uncle; \"let us start from that point and\\r\\ncount four days\\' storm, during which our rate cannot have been less\\r\\nthan eighty leagues in the twenty-four hours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is right; and this would make three hundred leagues more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and the Liedenbrock sea would be six hundred leagues from shore\\r\\nto shore. Surely, Axel, it may vie in size with the Mediterranean\\r\\nitself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Especially,\" I replied, \"if it happens that we have only crossed it\\r\\nin its narrowest part. And it is a curious circumstance,\" I added,\\r\\n\"that if my computations are right, and we are nine hundred leagues\\r\\nfrom Rejkiavik, we have now the Mediterranean above our head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a good long way, my friend. But whether we are under Turkey\\r\\nor the Atlantic depends very much upon the question in what direction\\r\\nwe have been moving. Perhaps we have deviated.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I think not. Our course has been the same all along, and I\\r\\nbelieve this shore is south-east of Port Graeuben.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" replied my uncle, \"we may easily ascertain this by consulting\\r\\nthe compass. Let us go and see what it says.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Professor moved towards the rock upon which Hans had laid down\\r\\nthe instruments. He was gay and full of spirits; he rubbed his hands,\\r\\nhe studied his attitudes. I followed him, curious to know if I was\\r\\nright in my estimate. As soon as we had arrived at the rock my uncle\\r\\ntook the compass, laid it horizontally, and questioned the needle,\\r\\nwhich, after a few oscillations, presently assumed a fixed position.\\r\\nMy uncle looked, and looked, and looked again. He rubbed his eyes,\\r\\nand then turned to me thunderstruck with some unexpected discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe motioned to me to look. An exclamation of astonishment burst from\\r\\nme. The north pole of the needle was turned to what we supposed to be\\r\\nthe south. It pointed to the shore instead of to the open sea! I\\r\\nshook the box, examined it again, it was in perfect condition. In\\r\\nwhatever position I placed the box the needle pertinaciously returned\\r\\nto this unexpected quarter. Therefore there seemed no reason to doubt\\r\\nthat during the storm there had been a sudden change of wind\\r\\nunperceived by us, which had brought our raft back to the shore which\\r\\nwe thought we had left so long a distance behind us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LIEDENBROCK MUSEUM OF GEOLOGY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I describe the strange series of passions which in\\r\\nsuccession shook the breast of Professor Liedenbrock? First\\r\\nstupefaction, then incredulity, lastly a downright burst of rage.\\r\\nNever had I seen the man so put out of countenance and so disturbed.\\r\\nThe fatigues of our passage across, the dangers met, had all to be\\r\\nbegun over again. We had gone backwards instead of forwards!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut my uncle rapidly recovered himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aha! will fate play tricks upon me? Will the elements lay plots\\r\\nagainst me? Shall fire, air, and water make a combined attack against\\r\\nme? Well, they shall know what a determined man can do. I will not\\r\\nyield. I will not stir a single foot backwards, and it will be seen\\r\\nwhether man or nature is to have the upper hand!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nErect upon the rock, angry and threatening, Otto Liedenbrock was a\\r\\nrather grotesque fierce parody upon the fierce Achilles defying the\\r\\nlightning. But I thought it my duty to interpose and attempt to lay\\r\\nsome restraint upon this unmeasured fanaticism.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just listen to me,\" I said firmly. \"Ambition must have a limit\\r\\nsomewhere; we cannot perform impossibilities; we are not at all fit\\r\\nfor another sea voyage; who would dream of undertaking a voyage of\\r\\nfive hundred leagues upon a heap of rotten planks, with a blanket in\\r\\nrags for a sail, a stick for a mast, and fierce winds in our teeth?\\r\\nWe cannot steer; we shall be buffeted by the tempests, and we should\\r\\nbe fools and madmen to attempt to cross a second time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was able to develop this series of unanswerable reasons for ten\\r\\nminutes without interruption; not that the Professor was paying any\\r\\nrespectful attention to his nephew\\'s arguments, but because he was\\r\\ndeaf to all my eloquence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To the raft!\" he shouted.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was his only reply. It was no use for me to entreat, supplicate,\\r\\nget angry, or do anything else in the way of opposition; it would\\r\\nonly have been opposing a will harder than the granite rock.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans was finishing the repairs of the raft. One would have thought\\r\\nthat this strange being was guessing at my uncle\\'s intentions. With a\\r\\nfew more pieces of surturbrand he had refitted our vessel. A sail\\r\\nalready hung from the new mast, and the wind was playing in its\\r\\nwaving folds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Professor said a few words to the guide, and immediately he put\\r\\neverything on board and arranged every necessary for our departure.\\r\\nThe air was clear--and the north-west wind blew steadily.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat could I do? Could I stand against the two? It was impossible? If\\r\\nHans had but taken my side! But no, it was not to be. The Icelander\\r\\nseemed to have renounced all will of his own and made a vow to forget\\r\\nand deny himself. I could get nothing out of a servant so feudalised,\\r\\nas it were, to his master. My only course was to proceed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was therefore going with as much resignation as I could find to\\r\\nresume my accustomed place on the raft, when my uncle laid his hand\\r\\nupon my shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall not sail until to-morrow,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nI made a movement intended to express resignation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must neglect nothing,\" he said; \"and since my fate has driven me\\r\\non this part of the coast, I will not leave it until I have examined\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo understand what followed, it must be borne in mind that, through\\r\\ncircumstances hereafter to be explained, we were not really where the\\r\\nProfessor supposed we were. In fact we were not upon the north shore\\r\\nof the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now let us start upon fresh discoveries,\" I said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd leaving Hans to his work we started off together. The space\\r\\nbetween the water and the foot of the cliffs was considerable. It\\r\\ntook half an hour to bring us to the wall of rock. We trampled under\\r\\nour feet numberless shells of all the forms and sizes which existed\\r\\nin the earliest ages of the world. I also saw immense carapaces more\\r\\nthan fifteen feet in diameter. They had been the coverings of those\\r\\ngigantic glyptodons or armadilloes of the pleiocene period, of which\\r\\nthe modern tortoise is but a miniature representative. [1] The soil\\r\\nwas besides this scattered with stony fragments, boulders rounded by\\r\\nwater action, and ridged up in successive lines. I was therefore led\\r\\nto the conclusion that at one time the sea must have covered the\\r\\nground on which we were treading. On the loose and scattered rocks,\\r\\nnow out of the reach of the highest tides, the waves had left\\r\\nmanifest traces of their power to wear their way in the hardest stone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis might up to a certain point explain the existence of an ocean\\r\\nforty leagues beneath the surface of the globe. But in my opinion\\r\\nthis liquid mass would be lost by degrees farther and farther within\\r\\nthe interior of the earth, and it certainly had its origin in the\\r\\nwaters of the ocean overhead, which had made their way hither through\\r\\nsome fissure. Yet it must be believed that that fissure is now\\r\\nclosed, and that all this cavern or immense reservoir was filled in a\\r\\nvery short time. Perhaps even this water, subjected to the fierce\\r\\naction of central heat, had partly been resolved into vapour. This\\r\\nwould explain the existence of those clouds suspended over our heads\\r\\nand the development of that electricity which raised such tempests\\r\\nwithin the bowels of the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis theory of the phenomena we had witnessed seemed satisfactory to\\r\\nme; for however great and stupendous the phenomena of nature, fixed\\r\\nphysical laws will or may always explain them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were therefore walking upon sedimentary soil, the deposits of the\\r\\nwaters of former ages. The Professor was carefully examining every\\r\\nlittle fissure in the rocks. Wherever he saw a hole he always wanted\\r\\nto know the depth of it. To him this was important.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had traversed the shores of the Liedenbrock sea for a mile when we\\r\\nobserved a sudden change in the appearance of the soil. It seemed\\r\\nupset, contorted, and convulsed by a violent upheaval of the lower\\r\\nstrata. In many places depressions or elevations gave witness to some\\r\\ntremendous power effecting the dislocation of strata.\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] The glyptodon and armadillo are mammalian; the tortoise is a\\r\\nchelonian, a reptile, distinct classes of the animal kingdom;\\r\\ntherefore the latter cannot be a representative of the former.\\r\\n(Trans.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe moved with difficulty across these granite fissures and chasms\\r\\nmingled with silex, crystals of quartz, and alluvial deposits, when a\\r\\nfield, nay, more than a field, a vast plain, of bleached bones lay\\r\\nspread before us. It seemed like an immense cemetery, where the\\r\\nremains of twenty ages mingled their dust together. Huge mounds of\\r\\nbony fragments rose stage after stage in the distance. They undulated\\r\\naway to the limits of the horizon, and melted in the distance in a\\r\\nfaint haze. There within three square miles were accumulated the\\r\\nmaterials for a complete history of the animal life of ages, a\\r\\nhistory scarcely outlined in the too recent strata of the inhabited\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut an impatient curiosity impelled our steps; crackling and\\r\\nrattling, our feet were trampling on the remains of prehistoric\\r\\nanimals and interesting fossils, the possession of which is a matter\\r\\nof rivalry and contention between the museums of great cities. A\\r\\nthousand Cuviers could never have reconstructed the organic remains\\r\\ndeposited in this magnificent and unparalleled collection.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stood amazed. My uncle had uplifted his long arms to the vault\\r\\nwhich was our sky; his mouth gaping wide, his eyes flashing behind\\r\\nhis shining spectacles, his head balancing with an up-and-down\\r\\nmotion, his whole attitude denoted unlimited astonishment. Here he\\r\\nstood facing an immense collection of scattered leptotheria,\\r\\nmericotheria, lophiodia, anoplotheria, megatheria, mastodons,\\r\\nprotopithecae, pterodactyles, and all sorts of extinct monsters here\\r\\nassembled together for his special satisfaction. Fancy an\\r\\nenthusiastic bibliomaniac suddenly brought into the midst of the\\r\\nfamous Alexandrian library burnt by Omar and restored by a miracle\\r\\nfrom its ashes! just such a crazed enthusiast was my uncle, Professor\\r\\nLiedenbrock.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut more was to come, when, with a rush through clouds of bone dust,\\r\\nhe laid his hand upon a bare skull, and cried with a voice trembling\\r\\nwith excitement:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Axel! Axel! a human head!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A human skull?\" I cried, no less astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, nephew. Aha! M. Milne-Edwards! Ah! M. de Quatrefages, how I\\r\\nwish you were standing here at the side of Otto Liedenbrock!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PROFESSOR IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo understand this apostrophe of my uncle\\'s, made to absent French\\r\\nsavants, it will be necessary to allude to an event of high\\r\\nimportance in a palaeontological point of view, which had occurred a\\r\\nlittle while before our departure.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 28th of March, 1863, some excavators working under the\\r\\ndirection of M. Boucher de Perthes, in the stone quarries of Moulin\\r\\nQuignon, near Abbeville, in the department of Somme, found a human\\r\\njawbone fourteen feet beneath the surface. It was the first fossil of\\r\\nthis nature that had ever been brought to light. Not far distant were\\r\\nfound stone hatchets and flint arrow-heads stained and encased by\\r\\nlapse of time with a uniform coat of rust.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe noise of this discovery was very great, not in France alone, but in\\r\\nEngland and in Germany. Several savants of the French Institute, and\\r\\namongst them MM. Milne-Edwards and de Quatrefages, saw at once the\\r\\nimportance of this discovery, proved to demonstration the genuineness of\\r\\nthe bone in question, and became the most ardent defendants in what the\\r\\nEnglish called this \\'trial of a jawbone.\\' To the geologists of the\\r\\nUnited Kingdom, who believed in the certainty of the fact--Messrs.\\r\\nFalconer, Busk, Carpenter, and others--scientific Germans were soon\\r\\njoined, and amongst them the forwardest, the most fiery, and the most\\r\\nenthusiastic, was my uncle Liedenbrock.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore the genuineness of a fossil human relic of the quaternary\\r\\nperiod seemed to be incontestably proved and admitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is true that this theory met with a most obstinate opponent in M.\\r\\nElie de Beaumont. This high authority maintained that the soil of\\r\\nMoulin Quignon was not diluvial at all, but was of much more recent\\r\\nformation; and, agreeing in that with Cuvier, he refused to admit\\r\\nthat the human species could be contemporary with the animals of the\\r\\nquaternary period. My uncle Liedenbrock, along with the great body of\\r\\nthe geologists, had maintained his ground, disputed, and argued,\\r\\nuntil M. Elie de Beaumont stood almost alone in his opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe knew all these details, but we were not aware that since our\\r\\ndeparture the question had advanced to farther stages. Other similar\\r\\nmaxillaries, though belonging to individuals of various types and\\r\\ndifferent nations, were found in the loose grey soil of certain\\r\\ngrottoes in France, Switzerland, and Belgium, as well as weapons,\\r\\ntools, earthen utensils, bones of children and adults. The existence\\r\\ntherefore of man in the quaternary period seemed to become daily more\\r\\ncertain.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor was this all. Fresh discoveries of remains in the pleiocene\\r\\nformation had emboldened other geologists to refer back the human\\r\\nspecies to a higher antiquity still. It is true that these remains\\r\\nwere not human bones, but objects bearing the traces of his\\r\\nhandiwork, such as fossil leg-bones of animals, sculptured and carved\\r\\nevidently by the hand of man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, at one bound, the record of the existence of man receded far\\r\\nback into the history of the ages past; he was a predecessor of the\\r\\nmastodon; he was a contemporary of the southern elephant; he lived a\\r\\nhundred thousand years ago, when, according to geologists, the\\r\\npleiocene formation was in progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch then was the state of palaeontological science, and what we knew\\r\\nof it was sufficient to explain our behaviour in the presence of this\\r\\nstupendous Golgotha. Any one may now understand the frenzied\\r\\nexcitement of my uncle, when, twenty yards farther on, he found\\r\\nhimself face to face with a primitive man!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a perfectly recognisable human body. Had some particular soil,\\r\\nlike that of the cemetery St. Michel, at Bordeaux, preserved it thus\\r\\nfor so many ages? It might be so. But this dried corpse, with its\\r\\nparchment-like skin drawn tightly over the bony frame, the limbs\\r\\nstill preserving their shape, sound teeth, abundant hair, and finger\\r\\nand toe nails of frightful length, this desiccated mummy startled us\\r\\nby appearing just as it had lived countless ages ago. I stood mute\\r\\nbefore this apparition of remote antiquity. My uncle, usually so\\r\\ngarrulous, was struck dumb likewise. We raised the body. We stood it\\r\\nup against a rock. It seemed to stare at us out of its empty orbits.\\r\\nWe sounded with our knuckles his hollow frame.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some moments\\' silence the Professor was himself again. Otto\\r\\nLiedenbrock, yielding to his nature, forgot all the circumstances of\\r\\nour eventful journey, forgot where we were standing, forgot the\\r\\nvaulted cavern which contained us. No doubt he was in mind back again\\r\\nin his Johannaeum, holding forth to his pupils, for he assumed his\\r\\nlearned air; and addressing himself to an imaginary audience, he\\r\\nproceeded thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gentlemen, I have the honour to introduce to you a man of the\\r\\nquaternary or post-tertiary system. Eminent geologists have denied\\r\\nhis existence, others no less eminent have affirmed it. The St.\\r\\nThomases of palaeontology, if they were here, might now touch him with\\r\\ntheir fingers, and would be obliged to acknowledge their error. I am\\r\\nquite aware that science has to be on its guard with discoveries of\\r\\nthis kind. I know what capital enterprising individuals like Barnum\\r\\nhave made out of fossil men. I have heard the tale of the kneepan of\\r\\nAjax, the pretended body of Orestes claimed to have been found by the\\r\\nSpartans, and of the body of Asterius, ten cubits long, of which\\r\\nPausanias speaks. I have read the reports of the skeleton of Trapani,\\r\\nfound in the fourteenth century, and which was at the time identified\\r\\nas that of Polyphemus; and the history of the giant unearthed in the\\r\\nsixteenth century near Palermo. You know as well as I do, gentlemen,\\r\\nthe analysis made at Lucerne in 1577 of those huge bones which the\\r\\ncelebrated Dr. Felix Plater affirmed to be those of a giant nineteen\\r\\nfeet high. I have gone through the treatises of Cassanion, and all\\r\\nthose memoirs, pamphlets, answers, and rejoinders published\\r\\nrespecting the skeleton of Teutobochus, the invader of Gaul, dug out\\r\\nof a sandpit in the Dauphine, in 1613. In the eighteenth century I\\r\\nwould have stood up for Scheuchzer\\'s pre-adamite man against Peter\\r\\nCampet. I have perused a writing, entitled Gigan--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere my uncle\\'s unfortunate infirmity met him--that of being unable\\r\\nin public to pronounce hard words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The pamphlet entitled Gigan--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could get no further.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Giganteo--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not to be done. The unlucky word would not come out. At the\\r\\nJohannaeum there would have been a laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gigantosteologie,\" at last the Professor burst out, between two\\r\\nwords which I shall not record here.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen rushing on with renewed vigour, and with great animation:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, gentlemen, I know all these things, and more. I know that\\r\\nCuvier and Blumenbach have recognised in these bones nothing more\\r\\nremarkable than the bones of the mammoth and other mammals of the\\r\\npost-tertiary period. But in the presence of this specimen to doubt\\r\\nwould be to insult science. There stands the body! You may see it,\\r\\ntouch it. It is not a mere skeleton; it is an entire body, preserved\\r\\nfor a purely anthropological end and purpose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was good enough not to contradict this startling assertion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I could only wash it in a solution of sulphuric acid,\" pursued my\\r\\nuncle, \"I should be able to clear it from all the earthy particles\\r\\nand the shells which are incrusted about it. But I do not possess\\r\\nthat valuable solvent. Yet, such as it is, the body shall tell us its\\r\\nown wonderful story.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the Professor laid hold of the fossil skeleton, and handled it\\r\\nwith the skill of a dexterous showman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see,\" he said, \"that it is not six feet long, and that we are\\r\\nstill separated by a long interval from the pretended race of giants.\\r\\nAs for the family to which it belongs, it is evidently Caucasian. It\\r\\nis the white race, our own. The skull of this fossil is a regular\\r\\noval, or rather ovoid. It exhibits no prominent cheekbones, no\\r\\nprojecting jaws. It presents no appearance of that prognathism which\\r\\ndiminishes the facial angle. [1] Measure that angle. It is nearly\\r\\nninety degrees. But I will go further in my deductions, and I will\\r\\naffirm that this specimen of the human family is of the Japhetic\\r\\nrace, which has since spread from the Indies to the Atlantic. Don\\'t\\r\\nsmile, gentlemen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody was smiling; but the learned Professor was frequently\\r\\ndisturbed by the broad smiles provoked by his learned eccentricities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" he pursued with animation, \"this is a fossil man, the\\r\\ncontemporary of the mastodons whose remains fill this amphitheatre.\\r\\nBut if you ask me how he came there, how those strata on which he lay\\r\\nslipped down into this enormous hollow in the globe, I confess I\\r\\ncannot answer that question. No doubt in the post-tertiary period\\r\\nconsiderable commotions were still disturbing the crust of the earth.\\r\\nThe long-continued cooling of the globe produced chasms, fissures,\\r\\nclefts, and faults, into which, very probably, portions of the upper\\r\\nearth may have fallen. I make no rash assertions; but there is the\\r\\nman surrounded by his own works, by hatchets, by flint arrow-heads,\\r\\nwhich are the characteristics of the stone age. And unless he came\\r\\nhere, like myself, as a tourist on a visit and as a pioneer of\\r\\nscience, I can entertain no doubt of the authenticity of his remote\\r\\norigin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] The facial angle is formed by two lines, one touching the brow\\r\\nand the front teeth, the other from the orifice of the ear to the\\r\\nlower line of the nostrils. The greater this angle, the higher\\r\\nintelligence denoted by the formation of the skull. Prognathism is\\r\\nthat projection of the jaw-bones which sharpens or lessons this\\r\\nangle, and which is illustrated in the negro countenance and in the\\r\\nlowest savages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Professor ceased to speak, and the audience broke out into loud\\r\\nand unanimous applause. For of course my uncle was right, and wiser\\r\\nmen than his nephew would have had some trouble to refute his\\r\\nstatements.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother remarkable thing. This fossil body was not the only one in\\r\\nthis immense catacomb. We came upon other bodies at every step\\r\\namongst this mortal dust, and my uncle might select the most curious\\r\\nof these specimens to demolish the incredulity of sceptics.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact it was a wonderful spectacle, that of these generations of\\r\\nmen and animals commingled in a common cemetery. Then one very\\r\\nserious question arose presently which we scarcely dared to suggest.\\r\\nHad all those creatures slided through a great fissure in the crust\\r\\nof the earth, down to the shores of the Liedenbrock sea, when they\\r\\nwere dead and turning to dust, or had they lived and grown and died\\r\\nhere in this subterranean world under a false sky, just like\\r\\ninhabitants of the upper earth? Until the present time we had seen\\r\\nalive only marine monsters and fishes. Might not some living man,\\r\\nsome native of the abyss, be yet a wanderer below on this desert\\r\\nstrand?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOREST SCENERY ILLUMINATED BY ELECTRICITY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor another half hour we trod upon a pavement of bones. We pushed on,\\r\\nimpelled by our burning curiosity. What other marvels did this cavern\\r\\ncontain? What new treasures lay here for science to unfold? I was\\r\\nprepared for any surprise, my imagination was ready for any\\r\\nastonishment however astounding.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had long lost sight of the sea shore behind the hills of bones.\\r\\nThe rash Professor, careless of losing his way, hurried me forward.\\r\\nWe advanced in silence, bathed in luminous electric fluid. By some\\r\\nphenomenon which I am unable to explain, it lighted up all sides of\\r\\nevery object equally. Such was its diffusiveness, there being no\\r\\ncentral point from which the light emanated, that shadows no longer\\r\\nexisted. You might have thought yourself under the rays of a vertical\\r\\nsun in a tropical region at noonday and the height of summer. No\\r\\nvapour was visible. The rocks, the distant mountains, a few isolated\\r\\nclumps of forest trees in the distance, presented a weird and\\r\\nwonderful aspect under these totally new conditions of a universal\\r\\ndiffusion of light. We were like Hoffmann\\'s shadowless man.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter walking a mile we reached the outskirts of a vast forest, but\\r\\nnot one of those forests of fungi which bordered Port Graeuben.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere was the vegetation of the tertiary period in its fullest blaze\\r\\nof magnificence. Tall palms, belonging to species no longer living,\\r\\nsplendid palmacites, firs, yews, cypress trees, thujas,\\r\\nrepresentatives of the conifers, were linked together by a tangled\\r\\nnetwork of long climbing plants. A soft carpet of moss and hepaticas\\r\\nluxuriously clothed the soil. A few sparkling streams ran almost in\\r\\nsilence under what would have been the shade of the trees, but that\\r\\nthere was no shadow. On their banks grew tree-ferns similar to those\\r\\nwe grow in hothouses. But a remarkable feature was the total absence\\r\\nof colour in all those trees, shrubs, and plants, growing without the\\r\\nlife-giving heat and light of the sun. Everything seemed mixed-up and\\r\\nconfounded in one uniform silver grey or light brown tint like that\\r\\nof fading and faded leaves. Not a green leaf anywhere, and the\\r\\nflowers--which were abundant enough in the tertiary period, which\\r\\nfirst gave birth to flowers--looked like brown-paper flowers,\\r\\nwithout colour or scent.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle Liedenbrock ventured to penetrate under this colossal grove.\\r\\nI followed him, not without fear. Since nature had here provided\\r\\nvegetable nourishment, why should not the terrible mammals be there\\r\\ntoo? I perceived in the broad clearings left by fallen trees, decayed\\r\\nwith age, leguminose plants, acerineae, rubiceae and many other eatable\\r\\nshrubs, dear to ruminant animals at every period. Then I observed,\\r\\nmingled together in confusion, trees of countries far apart on the\\r\\nsurface of the globe. The oak and the palm were growing side by side,\\r\\nthe Australian eucalyptus leaned against the Norwegian pine, the\\r\\nbirch-tree of the north mingled its foliage with New Zealand kauris.\\r\\nIt was enough to distract the most ingenious classifier of\\r\\nterrestrial botany.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly I halted. I drew back my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diffused light revealed the smallest object in the dense and\\r\\ndistant thickets. I had thought I saw--no! I did see, with my own\\r\\neyes, vast colossal forms moving amongst the trees. They were\\r\\ngigantic animals; it was a herd of mastodons--not fossil remains,\\r\\nbut living and resembling those the bones of which were found in the\\r\\nmarshes of Ohio in 1801. I saw those huge elephants whose long,\\r\\nflexible trunks were grouting and turning up the soil under the trees\\r\\nlike a legion of serpents. I could hear the crashing noise of their\\r\\nlong ivory tusks boring into the old decaying trunks. The boughs\\r\\ncracked, and the leaves torn away by cartloads went down the\\r\\ncavernous throats of the vast brutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, then, the dream in which I had had a vision of the prehistoric\\r\\nworld, of the tertiary and post-tertiary periods, was now realised.\\r\\nAnd there we were alone, in the bowels of the earth, at the mercy of\\r\\nits wild inhabitants!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle was gazing with intense and eager interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come on!\" said he, seizing my arm. \"Forward! forward!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I will not!\" I cried. \"We have no firearms. What could we do in the\\r\\nmidst of a herd of these four-footed giants? Come away, uncle--come! No\\r\\nhuman being may with safety dare the anger of these monstrous beasts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No human creature?\" replied my uncle in a lower voice. \"You are\\r\\nwrong, Axel. Look, look down there! I fancy I see a living creature\\r\\nsimilar to ourselves: it is a man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked, shaking my head incredulously. But though at first I was\\r\\nunbelieving I had to yield to the evidence of my senses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, at a distance of a quarter of a mile, leaning against the\\r\\ntrunk of a gigantic kauri, stood a human being, the Proteus of those\\r\\nsubterranean regions, a new son of Neptune, watching this countless\\r\\nherd of mastodons.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmanis pecoris custos, immanior ipse. [1]\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] \"The shepherd of gigantic herds, and huger still himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, truly, huger still himself. It was no longer a fossil being like\\r\\nhim whose dried remains we had easily lifted up in the field of\\r\\nbones; it was a giant, able to control those monsters. In stature he\\r\\nwas at least twelve feet high. His head, huge and unshapely as a\\r\\nbuffalo\\'s, was half hidden in the thick and tangled growth of his\\r\\nunkempt hair. It most resembled the mane of the primitive elephant.\\r\\nIn his hand he wielded with ease an enormous bough, a staff worthy of\\r\\nthis shepherd of the geologic period.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stood petrified and speechless with amazement. But he might see\\r\\nus! We must fly!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, do come!\" I said to my uncle, who for once allowed himself to\\r\\nbe persuaded.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another quarter of an hour our nimble heels had carried us beyond\\r\\nthe reach of this horrible monster.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet, now that I can reflect quietly, now that my spirit has grown\\r\\ncalm again, now that months have slipped by since this strange and\\r\\nsupernatural meeting, what am I to think? what am I to believe? I\\r\\nmust conclude that it was impossible that our senses had been\\r\\ndeceived, that our eyes did not see what we supposed they saw. No\\r\\nhuman being lives in this subterranean world; no generation of men\\r\\ndwells in those inferior caverns of the globe, unknown to and\\r\\nunconnected with the inhabitants of its surface. It is absurd to\\r\\nbelieve it!\\r\\n\\r\\nI had rather admit that it may have been some animal whose structure\\r\\nresembled the human, some ape or baboon of the early geological ages,\\r\\nsome protopitheca, or some mesopitheca, some early or middle ape like\\r\\nthat discovered by Mr. Lartet in the bone cave of Sansau. But this\\r\\ncreature surpassed in stature all the measurements known in modern\\r\\npalaeontology. But that a man, a living man, and therefore whole\\r\\ngenerations doubtless besides, should be buried there in the bowels\\r\\nof the earth, is impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, we had left behind us the luminous forest, dumb with\\r\\nastonishment, overwhelmed and struck down with a terror which\\r\\namounted to stupefaction. We kept running on for fear the horrible\\r\\nmonster might be on our track. It was a flight, a fall, like that\\r\\nfearful pulling and dragging which is peculiar to nightmare.\\r\\nInstinctively we got back to the Liedenbrock sea, and I cannot say\\r\\ninto what vagaries my mind would not have carried me but for a\\r\\ncircumstance which brought me back to practical matters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough I was certain that we were now treading upon a soil not\\r\\nhitherto touched by our feet, I often perceived groups of rocks which\\r\\nreminded me of those about Port Graeuben. Besides, this seemed to\\r\\nconfirm the indications of the needle, and to show that we had\\r\\nagainst our will returned to the north of the Liedenbrock sea.\\r\\nOccasionally we felt quite convinced. Brooks and waterfalls were\\r\\ntumbling everywhere from the projections in the rocks. I thought I\\r\\nrecognised the bed of surturbrand, our faithful Hansbach, and the\\r\\ngrotto in which I had recovered life and consciousness. Then a few\\r\\npaces farther on, the arrangement of the cliffs, the appearance of an\\r\\nunrecognised stream, or the strange outline of a rock, came to throw\\r\\nme again into doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nI communicated my doubts to my uncle. Like myself, he hesitated; he\\r\\ncould recognise nothing again amidst this monotonous scene.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Evidently,\" said I, \"we have not landed again at our original\\r\\nstarting point, but the storm has carried us a little higher, and if\\r\\nwe follow the shore we shall find Port Graeuben.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If that is the case it will be useless to continue our exploration,\\r\\nand we had better return to our raft. But, Axel, are you not\\r\\nmistaken?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is difficult to speak decidedly, uncle, for all these rocks are\\r\\nso very much alike. Yet I think I recognise the promontory at the\\r\\nfoot of which Hans constructed our launch. We must be very near the\\r\\nlittle port, if indeed this is not it,\" I added, examining a creek\\r\\nwhich I thought I recognised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Axel, we should at least find our own traces and I see nothing--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I do see,\" I cried, darting upon an object lying on the sand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I showed my uncle a rusty dagger which I had just picked up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" said he, \"had you this weapon with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I! No, certainly! But you, perhaps--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not that I am aware,\" said the Professor. \"I have never had this\\r\\nobject in my possession.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, this is strange!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Axel, it is very simple. The Icelanders often wear arms of this\\r\\nkind. This must have belonged to Hans, and he has lost it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI shook my head. Hans had never had an object like this in his\\r\\npossession.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did it not belong to some pre-adamite warrior?\" I cried, \"to some\\r\\nliving man, contemporary with the huge cattle-driver? But no. This is\\r\\nnot a relic of the stone age. It is not even of the iron age. This\\r\\nblade is steel--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle stopped me abruptly on my way to a dissertation which would\\r\\nhave taken me a long way, and said coolly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be calm, Axel, and reasonable. This dagger belongs to the sixteenth\\r\\ncentury; it is a poniard, such as gentlemen carried in their belts to\\r\\ngive the coup _de grace._ Its origin is Spanish. It was never either\\r\\nyours, or mine, or the hunter\\'s, nor did it belong to any of those\\r\\nhuman beings who may or may not inhabit this inner world. See, it was\\r\\nnever jagged like this by cutting men\\'s throats; its blade is coated\\r\\nwith a rust neither a day, nor a year, nor a hundred years old.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Professor was getting excited according to his wont, and was\\r\\nallowing his imagination to run away with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Axel, we are on the way towards the grand discovery. This blade has\\r\\nbeen left on the strand for from one to three hundred years, and has\\r\\nblunted its edge upon the rocks that fringe this subterranean sea!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it has not come alone. It has not twisted itself out of shape;\\r\\nsome one has been here before us!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes--a man has.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And who was that man?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man who has engraved his name somewhere with that dagger. That man\\r\\nwanted once more to mark the way to the centre of the earth. Let us\\r\\nlook about: look about!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, wonderfully interested, we peered all along the high wall,\\r\\npeeping into every fissure which might open out into a gallery.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so we arrived at a place where the shore was much narrowed. Here\\r\\nthe sea came to lap the foot of the steep cliff, leaving a passage no\\r\\nwider than a couple of yards. Between two boldly projecting rocks\\r\\nappeared the mouth of a dark tunnel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere, upon a granite slab, appeared two mysterious graven letters,\\r\\nhalf eaten away by time. They were the initials of the bold and\\r\\ndaring traveller:\\r\\n\\r\\n[Runic initials appear here]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A. S.,\" shouted my uncle. \"Arne Saknussemm! Arne Saknussemm\\r\\neverywhere!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XL.\\r\\n\\r\\nPREPARATIONS FOR BLASTING A PASSAGE TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the start upon this marvellous pilgrimage I had been through so\\r\\nmany astonishments that I might well be excused for thinking myself\\r\\nwell hardened against any further surprise. Yet at the sight of these\\r\\ntwo letters, engraved on this spot three hundred years ago, I stood\\r\\naghast in dumb amazement. Not only were the initials of the learned\\r\\nalchemist visible upon the living rock, but there lay the iron point\\r\\nwith which the letters had been engraved. I could no longer doubt of\\r\\nthe existence of that wonderful traveller and of the fact of his\\r\\nunparalleled journey, without the most glaring incredulity.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst these reflections were occupying me, Professor Liedenbrock had\\r\\nlaunched into a somewhat rhapsodical eulogium, of which Arne\\r\\nSaknussemm was, of course, the hero.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou marvellous genius!\" he cried, \"thou hast not forgotten one\\r\\nindication which might serve to lay open to mortals the road through\\r\\nthe terrestrial crust; and thy fellow-creatures may even now, after\\r\\nthe lapse of three centuries, again trace thy footsteps through these\\r\\ndeep and darksome ways. You reserved the contemplation of these\\r\\nwonders for other eyes besides your own. Your name, graven from stage\\r\\nto stage, leads the bold follower of your footsteps to the very\\r\\ncentre of our planet\\'s core, and there again we shall find your own\\r\\nname written with your own hand. I too will inscribe my name upon\\r\\nthis dark granite page. But for ever henceforth let this cape that\\r\\nadvances into the sea discovered by yourself be known by your own\\r\\nillustrious name--Cape Saknussemm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch were the glowing words of panegyric which fell upon my attentive\\r\\near, and I could not resist the sentiment of enthusiasm with which I\\r\\ntoo was infected. The fire of zeal kindled afresh in me. I forgot\\r\\neverything. I dismissed from my mind the past perils of the journey,\\r\\nthe future danger of our return. That which another had done I\\r\\nsupposed we might also do, and nothing that was not superhuman\\r\\nappeared impossible to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Forward! forward!\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was already darting down the gloomy tunnel when the Professor\\r\\nstopped me; he, the man of impulse, counselled patience and coolness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us first return to Hans,\" he said, \"and bring the raft to this\\r\\nspot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI obeyed, not without dissatisfaction, and passed out rapidly among\\r\\nthe rocks on the shore.\\r\\n\\r\\nI said: \"Uncle, do you know it seems to me that circumstances have\\r\\nwonderfully befriended us hitherto?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You think so, Axel?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No doubt; even the tempest has put us on the right way. Blessings on\\r\\nthat storm! It has brought us back to this coast from which fine\\r\\nweather would have carried us far away. Suppose we had touched with\\r\\nour prow (the prow of a rudder!) the southern shore of the\\r\\nLiedenbrock sea, what would have become of us? We should never have\\r\\nseen the name of Saknussemm, and we should at this moment be\\r\\nimprisoned on a rockbound, impassable coast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Axel, it is providential that whilst supposing we were steering\\r\\nsouth we should have just got back north at Cape Saknussemm. I must\\r\\nsay that this is astonishing, and that I feel I have no way to\\r\\nexplain it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does that signify, uncle? Our business is not to explain facts,\\r\\nbut to use them!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly; but--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, uncle, we are going to resume the northern route, and to pass\\r\\nunder the north countries of Europe--under Sweden, Russia, Siberia:\\r\\nwho knows where?--instead of burrowing under the deserts of Africa,\\r\\nor perhaps the waves of the Atlantic; and that is all I want to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Axel, you are right. It is all for the best, since we have left\\r\\nthat weary, horizontal sea, which led us nowhere. Now we shall go\\r\\ndown, down, down! Do you know that it is now only 1,500 leagues to\\r\\nthe centre of the globe?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is that all?\" I cried. \"Why, that\\'s nothing. Let us start: march!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this crazy talk was going on still when we met the hunter.\\r\\nEverything was made ready for our instant departure. Every bit of\\r\\ncordage was put on board. We took our places, and with our sail set,\\r\\nHans steered us along the coast to Cape Saknussemm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wind was unfavourable to a species of launch not calculated for\\r\\nshallow water. In many places we were obliged to push ourselves along\\r\\nwith iron-pointed sticks. Often the sunken rocks just beneath the\\r\\nsurface obliged us to deviate from our straight course. At last,\\r\\nafter three hours\\' sailing, about six in the evening we reached a\\r\\nplace suitable for our landing. I jumped ashore, followed by my uncle\\r\\nand the Icelander. This short passage had not served to cool my\\r\\nardour. On the contrary, I even proposed to burn \\'our ship,\\' to\\r\\nprevent the possibility of return; but my uncle would not consent to\\r\\nthat. I thought him singularly lukewarm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At least,\" I said, \"don\\'t let us lose a minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, lad,\" he replied; \"but first let us examine this new\\r\\ngallery, to see if we shall require our ladders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle put his Ruhmkorff\\'s apparatus in action; the raft moored to\\r\\nthe shore was left alone; the mouth of the tunnel was not twenty\\r\\nyards from us; and our party, with myself at the head, made for it\\r\\nwithout a moment\\'s delay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aperture, which was almost round, was about five feet in\\r\\ndiameter; the dark passage was cut out in the live rock and lined\\r\\nwith a coat of the eruptive matter which formerly issued from it; the\\r\\ninterior was level with the ground outside, so that we were able to\\r\\nenter without difficulty. We were following a horizontal plane, when,\\r\\nonly six paces in, our progress was interrupted by an enormous block\\r\\njust across our way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Accursed rock!\" I cried in a passion, finding myself suddenly\\r\\nconfronted by an impassable obstacle.\\r\\n\\r\\nRight and left we searched in vain for a way, up and down, side to\\r\\nside; there was no getting any farther. I felt fearfully\\r\\ndisappointed, and I would not admit that the obstacle was final. I\\r\\nstopped, I looked underneath the block: no opening. Above: granite\\r\\nstill. Hans passed his lamp over every portion of the barrier in\\r\\nvain. We must give up all hope of passing it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down in despair. My uncle strode from side to side in the\\r\\nnarrow passage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how was it with Saknussemm?\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said my uncle, \"was he stopped by this stone barrier?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" I replied with animation. \"This fragment of rock has been\\r\\nshaken down by some shock or convulsion, or by one of those magnetic\\r\\nstorms which agitate these regions, and has blocked up the passage\\r\\nwhich lay open to him. Many years have elapsed since the return of\\r\\nSaknussemm to the surface and the fall of this huge fragment. Is it\\r\\nnot evident that this gallery was once the way open to the course of\\r\\nthe lava, and that at that time there must have been a free passage?\\r\\nSee here are recent fissures grooving and channelling the granite\\r\\nroof. This roof itself is formed of fragments of rock carried down,\\r\\nof enormous stones, as if by some giant\\'s hand; but at one time the\\r\\nexpulsive force was greater than usual, and this block, like the\\r\\nfalling keystone of a ruined arch, has slipped down to the ground and\\r\\nblocked up the way. It is only an accidental obstruction, not met by\\r\\nSaknussemm, and if we don\\'t destroy it we shall be unworthy to reach\\r\\nthe centre of the earth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was my sentence! The soul of the Professor had passed into me.\\r\\nThe genius of discovery possessed me wholly. I forgot the past, I\\r\\nscorned the future. I gave not a thought to the things of the surface\\r\\nof this globe into which I had dived; its cities and its sunny\\r\\nplains, Hamburg and the Koenigstrasse, even poor Graeuben, who must\\r\\nhave given us up for lost, all were for the time dismissed from the\\r\\npages of my memory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" cried my uncle, \"let us make a way with our pickaxes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Too hard for the pickaxe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, the spade.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That would take us too long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why gunpowder, to be sure! Let us mine the obstacle and blow it up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, it is only a bit of rock to blast!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hans, to work!\" cried my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Icelander returned to the raft and soon came back with an iron\\r\\nbar which he made use of to bore a hole for the charge. This was no\\r\\neasy work. A hole was to be made large enough to hold fifty pounds of\\r\\nguncotton, whose expansive force is four times that of gunpowder.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was terribly excited. Whilst Hans was at work I was actively\\r\\nhelping my uncle to prepare a slow match of wetted powder encased in\\r\\nlinen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This will do it,\" I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will,\" replied my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy midnight our mining preparations were over; the charge was rammed\\r\\ninto the hole, and the slow match uncoiled along the gallery showed\\r\\nits end outside the opening.\\r\\n\\r\\nA spark would now develop the whole of our preparations into activity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To-morrow,\" said the Professor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had to be resigned and to wait six long hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLI.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GREAT EXPLOSION AND THE RUSH DOWN BELOW\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, Thursday, August 27, is a well-remembered date in our\\r\\nsubterranean journey. It never returns to my memory without sending\\r\\nthrough me a shudder of horror and a palpitation of the heart. From\\r\\nthat hour we had no further occasion for the exercise of reason, or\\r\\njudgment, or skill, or contrivance. We were henceforth to be hurled\\r\\nalong, the playthings of the fierce elements of the deep.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt six we were afoot. The moment drew near to clear a way by blasting\\r\\nthrough the opposing mass of granite.\\r\\n\\r\\nI begged for the honour of lighting the fuse. This duty done, I was\\r\\nto join my companions on the raft, which had not yet been unloaded;\\r\\nwe should then push off as far as we could and avoid the dangers\\r\\narising from the explosion, the effects of which were not likely to\\r\\nbe confined to the rock itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fuse was calculated to burn ten minutes before setting fire to\\r\\nthe mine. I therefore had sufficient time to get away to the raft.\\r\\n\\r\\nI prepared to fulfil my task with some anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a hasty meal, my uncle and the hunter embarked whilst I\\r\\nremained on shore. I was supplied with a lighted lantern to set fire\\r\\nto the fuse. \"Now go,\" said my uncle, \"and return immediately to us.\"\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be uneasy,\" I replied. \"I will not play by the way.\" I\\r\\nimmediately proceeded to the mouth of the tunnel. I opened my\\r\\nlantern. I laid hold of the end of the match. The Professor stood,\\r\\nchronometer in hand. \"Ready?\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fire!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI instantly plunged the end of the fuse into the lantern. It\\r\\nspluttered and flamed, and I ran at the top of my speed to the raft.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come on board quickly, and let us push off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHans, with a vigorous thrust, sent us from the shore. The raft shot\\r\\ntwenty fathoms out to sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a moment of intense excitement. The Professor was watching the\\r\\nhand of the chronometer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Five minutes more!\" he said. \"Four! Three!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy pulse beat half-seconds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two! One! Down, granite rocks; down with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat took place at that moment? I believe I did not hear the dull\\r\\nroar of the explosion. But the rocks suddenly assumed a new\\r\\narrangement: they rent asunder like a curtain. I saw a bottomless pit\\r\\nopen on the shore. The sea, lashed into sudden fury, rose up in an\\r\\nenormous billow, on the ridge of which the unhappy raft was uplifted\\r\\nbodily in the air with all its crew and cargo.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all three fell down flat. In less than a second we were in deep,\\r\\nunfathomable darkness. Then I felt as if not only myself but the raft\\r\\nalso had no support beneath. I thought it was sinking; but it was not\\r\\nso. I wanted to speak to my uncle, but the roaring of the waves\\r\\nprevented him from hearing even the sound of my voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of darkness, noise, astonishment, and terror, I then\\r\\nunderstood what had taken place.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other side of the blown-up rock was an abyss. The explosion\\r\\nhad caused a kind of earthquake in this fissured and abysmal region;\\r\\na great gulf had opened; and the sea, now changed into a torrent, was\\r\\nhurrying us along into it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gave myself up for lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour passed away--two hours, perhaps--I cannot tell. We clutched\\r\\neach other fast, to save ourselves from being thrown off the raft. We\\r\\nfelt violent shocks whenever we were borne heavily against the craggy\\r\\nprojections. Yet these shocks were not very frequent, from which I\\r\\nconcluded that the gully was widening. It was no doubt the same road\\r\\nthat Saknussemm had taken; but instead of walking peaceably down it,\\r\\nas he had done, we were carrying a whole sea along with us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese ideas, it will be understood, presented themselves to my mind\\r\\nin a vague and undetermined form. I had difficulty in associating any\\r\\nideas together during this headlong race, which seemed like a\\r\\nvertical descent. To judge by the air which was whistling past me and\\r\\nmade a whizzing in my ears, we were moving faster than the fastest\\r\\nexpress trains. To light a torch under these\\' conditions would have\\r\\nbeen impossible; and our last electric apparatus had been shattered\\r\\nby the force of the explosion.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was therefore much surprised to see a clear light shining near me.\\r\\nIt lighted up the calm and unmoved countenance of Hans. The skilful\\r\\nhuntsman had succeeded in lighting the lantern; and although it\\r\\nflickered so much as to threaten to go out, it threw a fitful light\\r\\nacross the awful darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was right in my supposition. It was a wide gallery. The dim light\\r\\ncould not show us both its walls at once. The fall of the waters\\r\\nwhich were carrying us away exceeded that of the swiftest rapids in\\r\\nAmerican rivers. Its surface seemed composed of a sheaf of arrows\\r\\nhurled with inconceivable force; I cannot convey my impressions by a\\r\\nbetter comparison. The raft, occasionally seized by an eddy, spun\\r\\nround as it still flew along. When it approached the walls of the\\r\\ngallery I threw on them the light of the lantern, and I could judge\\r\\nsomewhat of the velocity of our speed by noticing how the jagged\\r\\nprojections of the rocks spun into endless ribbons and bands, so that\\r\\nwe seemed confined within a network of shifting lines. I supposed we\\r\\nwere running at the rate of thirty leagues an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle and I gazed on each other with haggard eyes, clinging to the\\r\\nstump of the mast, which had snapped asunder at the first shock of\\r\\nour great catastrophe. We kept our backs to the wind, not to be\\r\\nstifled by the rapidity of a movement which no human power could\\r\\ncheck.\\r\\n\\r\\nHours passed away. No change in our situation; but a discovery came\\r\\nto complicate matters and make them worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn seeking to put our cargo into somewhat better order, I found that\\r\\nthe greater part of the articles embarked had disappeared at the\\r\\nmoment of the explosion, when the sea broke in upon us with such\\r\\nviolence. I wanted to know exactly what we had saved, and with the\\r\\nlantern in my hand I began my examination. Of our instruments none\\r\\nwere saved but the compass and the chronometer; our stock of ropes\\r\\nand ladders was reduced to the bit of cord rolled round the stump of\\r\\nthe mast! Not a spade, not a pickaxe, not a hammer was left us; and,\\r\\nirreparable disaster! we had only one day\\'s provisions left.\\r\\n\\r\\nI searched every nook and corner, every crack and cranny in the raft.\\r\\nThere was nothing. Our provisions were reduced to one bit of salt\\r\\nmeat and a few biscuits.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stared at our failing supplies stupidly. I refused to take in the\\r\\ngravity of our loss. And yet what was the use of troubling myself. If\\r\\nwe had had provisions enough for months, how could we get out of the\\r\\nabyss into which we were being hurled by an irresistible torrent? Why\\r\\nshould we fear the horrors of famine, when death was swooping down\\r\\nupon us in a multitude of other forms? Would there be time left to\\r\\ndie of starvation?\\r\\n\\r\\nYet by an inexplicable play of the imagination I forgot my present\\r\\ndangers, to contemplate the threatening future. Was there any chance\\r\\nof escaping from the fury of this impetuous torrent, and of returning\\r\\nto the surface of the globe? I could not form the slightest\\r\\nconjecture how or when. But one chance in a thousand, or ten\\r\\nthousand, is still a chance; whilst death from starvation would leave\\r\\nus not the smallest hope in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought came into my mind to declare the whole truth to my uncle,\\r\\nto show him the dreadful straits to which we were reduced, and to\\r\\ncalculate how long we might yet expect to live. But I had the courage\\r\\nto preserve silence. I wished to leave him cool and self-possessed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment the light from our lantern began to sink by little and\\r\\nlittle, and then went out entirely. The wick had burnt itself out.\\r\\nBlack night reigned again; and there was no hope left of being able\\r\\nto dissipate the palpable darkness. We had yet a torch left, but we\\r\\ncould not have kept it alight. Then, like a child, I closed my eyes\\r\\nfirmly, not to see the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a considerable lapse of time our speed redoubled. I could\\r\\nperceive it by the sharpness of the currents that blew past my face.\\r\\nThe descent became steeper. I believe we were no longer sliding, but\\r\\nfalling down. I had an impression that we were dropping vertically.\\r\\nMy uncle\\'s hand, and the vigorous arm of Hans, held me fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, after a space of time that I could not measure, I felt a\\r\\nshock. The raft had not struck against any hard resistance, but had\\r\\nsuddenly been checked in its fall. A waterspout, an immense liquid\\r\\ncolumn, was beating upon the surface of the waters. I was\\r\\nsuffocating! I was drowning!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this sudden flood was not of long duration. In a few seconds I\\r\\nfound myself in the air again, which I inhaled with all the force of\\r\\nmy lungs. My uncle and Hans were still holding me fast by the arms;\\r\\nand the raft was still carrying us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLII.\\r\\n\\r\\nHEADLONG SPEED UPWARD THROUGH THE HORRORS OF DARKNESS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt might have been, as I guessed, about ten at night. The first of my\\r\\nsenses which came into play after this last bout was that of hearing.\\r\\nAll at once I could hear; and it was a real exercise of the sense of\\r\\nhearing. I could hear the silence in the gallery after the din which\\r\\nfor hours had stunned me. At last these words of my uncle\\'s came to\\r\\nme like a vague murmuring:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are going up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, we are going up--up!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI stretched out my arm. I touched the wall, and drew back my hand\\r\\nbleeding. We were ascending with extreme rapidity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The torch! The torch!\" cried the Professor.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot without difficulty Hans succeeded in lighting the torch; and the\\r\\nflame, preserving its upward tendency, threw enough light to show us\\r\\nwhat kind of a place we were in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as I thought,\" said the Professor \"We are in a tunnel not\\r\\nfour-and-twenty feet in diameter. The water had reached the bottom of\\r\\nthe gulf. It is now rising to its level, and carrying us with it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot tell; but we must be ready for anything. We are mounting at\\r\\na speed which seems to me of fourteen feet in a second, or ten miles\\r\\nan hour. At this rate we shall get on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, if nothing stops us; if this well has an aperture. But suppose\\r\\nit to be stopped. If the air is condensed by the pressure of this\\r\\ncolumn of water we shall be crushed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Axel,\" replied the Professor with perfect coolness, \"our situation\\r\\nis almost desperate; but there are some chances of deliverance, and\\r\\nit is these that I am considering. If at every instant we may perish,\\r\\nso at every instant we may be saved. Let us then be prepared to seize\\r\\nupon the smallest advantage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what shall we do now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Recruit our strength by eating.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt these words I fixed a haggard eye upon my uncle. That which I had\\r\\nbeen so unwilling to confess at last had to be told.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eat, did you say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, at once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Professor added a few words in Danish, but Hans shook his head\\r\\nmournfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What!\" cried my uncle. \"Have we lost our provisions?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; here is all we have left; one bit of salt meat for the three.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle stared at me as if he could not understand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said I, \"do you think we have any chance of being saved?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy question was unanswered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour passed away. I began to feel the pangs of a violent hunger.\\r\\nMy companions were suffering too, and not one of us dared touch this\\r\\nwretched remnant of our goodly store.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now we were mounting up with excessive speed. Sometimes the air\\r\\nwould cut our breath short, as is experienced by aeronauts ascending\\r\\ntoo rapidly. But whilst they suffer from cold in proportion to their\\r\\nrise, we were beginning to feel a contrary effect. The heat was\\r\\nincreasing in a manner to cause us the most fearful anxiety, and\\r\\ncertainly the temperature was at this moment at the height of 100 deg.\\r\\nFahr.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat could be the meaning of such a change? Up to this time facts had\\r\\nsupported the theories of Davy and of Liedenbrock; until now\\r\\nparticular conditions of non-conducting rocks, electricity and\\r\\nmagnetism, had tempered the laws of nature, giving us only a\\r\\nmoderately warm climate, for the theory of a central fire remained in\\r\\nmy estimation the only one that was true and explicable. Were we then\\r\\nturning back to where the phenomena of central heat ruled in all\\r\\ntheir rigour and would reduce the most refractory rocks to the state\\r\\nof a molten liquid? I feared this, and said to the Professor:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we are neither drowned, nor shattered to pieces, nor starved to\\r\\ndeath, there is still the chance that we may be burned alive and\\r\\nreduced to ashes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this he shrugged his shoulders and returned to his thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother hour passed, and, except some slight increase in the\\r\\ntemperature, nothing new had happened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" said he, \"we must determine upon something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Determine on what?\" said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, we must recruit our strength by carefully rationing ourselves,\\r\\nand so prolong our existence by a few hours. But we shall be reduced\\r\\nto very great weakness at last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And our last hour is not far off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, if there is a chance of safety, if a moment for active\\r\\nexertion presents itself, where should we find the required strength\\r\\nif we allowed ourselves to be enfeebled by hunger?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, uncle, when this bit of meat has been devoured what shall we\\r\\nhave left?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing, Axel, nothing at all. But will it do you any more good to\\r\\ndevour it with your eyes than with your teeth? Your reasoning has in\\r\\nit neither sense nor energy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then don\\'t you despair?\" I cried irritably.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, certainly not,\" was the Professor\\'s firm reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! do you think there is any chance of safety left?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I do; as long as the heart beats, as long as body and soul keep\\r\\ntogether, I cannot admit that any creature endowed with a will has\\r\\nneed to despair of life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nResolute words these! The man who could speak so, under such\\r\\ncircumstances, was of no ordinary type.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Finally, what do you mean to do?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eat what is left to the last crumb, and recruit our fading strength.\\r\\nThis meal will be our last, perhaps: so let it be! But at any rate we\\r\\nshall once more be men, and not exhausted, empty bags.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, let us consume it then,\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle took the piece of meat and the few biscuits which had\\r\\nescaped from the general destruction. He divided them into three\\r\\nequal portions and gave one to each. This made about a pound of\\r\\nnourishment for each. The Professor ate his greedily, with a kind of\\r\\nfeverish rage. I ate without pleasure, almost with disgust; Hans\\r\\nquietly, moderately, masticating his small mouthfuls without any\\r\\nnoise, and relishing them with the calmness of a man above all\\r\\nanxiety about the future. By diligent search he had found a flask of\\r\\nHollands; he offered it to us each in turn, and this generous\\r\\nbeverage cheered us up slightly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Fortraefflig,_\" said Hans, drinking in his turn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excellent,\" replied my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\nA glimpse of hope had returned, although without cause. But our last\\r\\nmeal was over, and it was now five in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nMan is so constituted that health is a purely negative state. Hunger\\r\\nonce satisfied, it is difficult for a man to imagine the horrors of\\r\\nstarvation; they cannot be understood without being felt.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore it was that after our long fast these few mouthfuls of meat\\r\\nand biscuit made us triumph over our past agonies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as soon as the meal was done, we each of us fell deep into\\r\\nthought. What was Hans thinking of--that man of the far West, but\\r\\nwho seemed ruled by the fatalist doctrines of the East?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for me, my thoughts were made up of remembrances, and they carried\\r\\nme up to the surface of the globe of which I ought never to have\\r\\ntaken leave. The house in the Koenigstrasse, my poor dear Graeuben,\\r\\nthat kind soul Martha, flitted like visions before my eyes, and in\\r\\nthe dismal moanings which from time to time reached my ears I thought\\r\\nI could distinguish the roar of the traffic of the great cities upon\\r\\nearth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle still had his eye upon his work. Torch in hand, he tried to\\r\\ngather some idea of our situation from the observation of the strata.\\r\\nThis calculation could, at best, be but a vague approximation; but a\\r\\nlearned man is always a philosopher when he succeeds in remaining\\r\\ncool, and assuredly Professor Liedenbrock possessed this quality to a\\r\\nsurprising degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could hear him murmuring geological terms. I could understand them,\\r\\nand in spite of myself I felt interested in this last geological\\r\\nstudy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eruptive granite,\" he was saying. \"We are still in the primitive\\r\\nperiod. But we are going up, up, higher still. Who can tell?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! who can tell? With his hand he was examining the perpendicular\\r\\nwall, and in a few more minutes he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is gneiss! here is mica schist! Ah! presently we shall come to\\r\\nthe transition period, and then--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat did the Professor mean? Could he be trying to measure the\\r\\nthickness of the crust of the earth that lay between us and the world\\r\\nabove? Had he any means of making this calculation? No, he had not\\r\\nthe aneroid, and no guessing could supply its place.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill the temperature kept rising, and I felt myself steeped in a\\r\\nbroiling atmosphere. I could only compare it to the heat of a furnace\\r\\nat the moment when the molten metal is running into the mould.\\r\\nGradually we had been obliged to throw aside our coats and\\r\\nwaistcoats, the lightest covering became uncomfortable and even\\r\\npainful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are we rising into a fiery furnace?\" I cried at one moment when the\\r\\nheat was redoubling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied my uncle, \"that is impossible--quite impossible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet,\" I answered, feeling the wall, \"this well is burning hot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same moment, touching the water, I had to withdraw my hand in\\r\\nhaste.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The water is scalding,\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time the Professor\\'s only answer was an angry gesture.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen an unconquerable terror seized upon me, from which I could no\\r\\nlonger get free. I felt that a catastrophe was approaching before\\r\\nwhich the boldest spirit must quail. A dim, vague notion laid hold of\\r\\nmy mind, but which was fast hardening into certainty. I tried to\\r\\nrepel it, but it would return. I dared not express it in plain terms.\\r\\nYet a few involuntary observations confirmed me in my view. By the\\r\\nflickering light of the torch I could distinguish contortions in the\\r\\ngranite beds; a phenomenon was unfolding in which electricity would\\r\\nplay the principal part; then this unbearable heat, this boiling\\r\\nwater! I consulted the compass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe compass had lost its properties! it had ceased to act properly!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nSHOT OUT OF A VOLCANO AT LAST!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYes: our compass was no longer a guide; the needle flew from pole to\\r\\npole with a kind of frenzied impulse; it ran round the dial, and spun\\r\\nhither and thither as if it were giddy or intoxicated.\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew quite well that according to the best received theories the\\r\\nmineral covering of the globe is never at absolute rest; the changes\\r\\nbrought about by the chemical decomposition of its component parts,\\r\\nthe agitation caused by great liquid torrents, and the magnetic\\r\\ncurrents, are continually tending to disturb it--even when living\\r\\nbeings upon its surface may fancy that all is quiet below. A\\r\\nphenomenon of this kind would not have greatly alarmed me, or at any\\r\\nrate it would not have given rise to dreadful apprehensions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut other facts, other circumstances, of a peculiar nature, came to\\r\\nreveal to me by degrees the true state of the case. There came\\r\\nincessant and continuous explosions. I could only compare them to the\\r\\nloud rattle of a long train of chariots driven at full speed over the\\r\\nstones, or a roar of unintermitting thunder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the disordered compass, thrown out of gear by the electric\\r\\ncurrents, confirmed me in a growing conviction. The mineral crust of\\r\\nthe globe threatened to burst up, the granite foundations to come\\r\\ntogether with a crash, the fissure through which we were helplessly\\r\\ndriven would be filled up, the void would be full of crushed\\r\\nfragments of rock, and we poor wretched mortals were to be buried and\\r\\nannihilated in this dreadful consummation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My uncle,\" I cried, \"we are lost now, utterly lost!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you in a fright about now?\" was the calm rejoinder. \"What\\r\\nis the matter with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The matter? Look at those quaking walls! look at those shivering\\r\\nrocks. Don\\'t you feel the burning heat? Don\\'t you see how the water\\r\\nboils and bubbles? Are you blind to the dense vapours and steam\\r\\ngrowing thicker and denser every minute? See this agitated compass\\r\\nneedle. It is an earthquake that is threatening us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy undaunted uncle calmly shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think,\" said he, \"an earthquake is coming?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I think you are mistaken.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! don\\'t you recognise the symptoms?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of an earthquake? no! I am looking out for something better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can you mean? Explain?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is an eruption, Axel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An eruption! Do you mean to affirm that we are running up the shaft\\r\\nof a volcano?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe we are,\" said the indomitable Professor with an air of\\r\\nperfect self-possession; \"and it is the best thing that could\\r\\npossibly happen to us under our circumstances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best thing! Was my uncle stark mad? What did the man mean? and\\r\\nwhat was the use of saying facetious things at a time like this?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What!\" I shouted. \"Are we being taken up in an eruption? Our fate\\r\\nhas flung us here among burning lavas, molten rocks, boiling waters,\\r\\nand all kinds of volcanic matter; we are going to be pitched out,\\r\\nexpelled, tossed up, vomited, spit out high into the air, along with\\r\\nfragments of rock, showers of ashes and scoria, in the midst of a\\r\\ntowering rush of smoke and flames; and it is the best thing that\\r\\ncould happen to us!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied the Professor, eyeing me over his spectacles, \"I don\\'t\\r\\nsee any other way of reaching the surface of the earth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI pass rapidly over the thousand ideas which passed through my mind.\\r\\nMy uncle was right, undoubtedly right; and never had he seemed to me\\r\\nmore daring and more confirmed in his notions than at this moment\\r\\nwhen he was calmly contemplating the chances of being shot out of a\\r\\nvolcano!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime up we went; the night passed away in continual\\r\\nascent; the din and uproar around us became more and more\\r\\nintensified; I was stifled and stunned; I thought my last hour was\\r\\napproaching; and yet imagination is such a strong thing that even in\\r\\nthis supreme hour I was occupied with strange and almost childish\\r\\nspeculations. But I was the victim, not the master, of my own\\r\\nthoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was very evident that we were being hurried upward upon the crest\\r\\nof a wave of eruption; beneath our raft were boiling waters, and\\r\\nunder these the more sluggish lava was working its way up in a heated\\r\\nmass, together with shoals of fragments of rock which, when they\\r\\narrived at the crater, would be dispersed in all directions high and\\r\\nlow. We were imprisoned in the shaft or chimney of some volcano.\\r\\nThere was no room to doubt of that.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this time, instead of Snaefell, an extinct volcano, we were inside\\r\\none in full activity. I wondered, therefore, where could this\\r\\nmountain be, and in what part of the world we were to be shot out.\\r\\n\\r\\nI made no doubt but that it would be in some northern region. Before\\r\\nits disorders set in, the needle had never deviated from that\\r\\ndirection. From Cape Saknussemm we had been carried due north for\\r\\nhundreds of leagues. Were we under Iceland again? Were we destined to\\r\\nbe thrown up out of Hecla, or by which of the seven other fiery\\r\\ncraters in that island? Within a radius of five hundred leagues to\\r\\nthe west I remembered under this parallel of latitude only the\\r\\nimperfectly known volcanoes of the north-east coast of America. To\\r\\nthe east there was only one in the 80th degree of north latitude, the\\r\\nEsk in Jan Mayen Island, not far from Spitzbergen! Certainly there\\r\\nwas no lack of craters, and there were some capacious enough to throw\\r\\nout a whole army! But I wanted to know which of them was to serve us\\r\\nfor an exit from the inner world.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards morning the ascending movement became accelerated. If the\\r\\nheat increased, instead of diminishing, as we approached nearer to\\r\\nthe surface of the globe, this effect was due to local causes alone,\\r\\nand those volcanic. The manner of our locomotion left no doubt in my\\r\\nmind. An enormous force, a force of hundreds of atmospheres,\\r\\ngenerated by the extreme pressure of confined vapours, was driving us\\r\\nirresistibly forward. But to what numberless dangers it exposed us!\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon lurid lights began to penetrate the vertical gallery which\\r\\nwidened as we went up. Right and left I could see deep channels, like\\r\\nhuge tunnels, out of which escaped dense volumes of smoke; tongues of\\r\\nfire lapped the walls, which crackled and sputtered under the intense\\r\\nheat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See, see, my uncle!\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, those are only sulphureous flames and vapours, which one must\\r\\nexpect to see in an eruption. They are quite natural.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But suppose they should wrap us round.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But they won\\'t wrap us round.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But we shall be stifled.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall not be stifled at all. The gallery is widening, and if it\\r\\nbecomes necessary, we shall abandon the raft, and creep into a\\r\\ncrevice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the water--the rising water?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is no more water, Axel; only a lava paste, which is bearing us\\r\\nup on its surface to the top of the crater.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquid column had indeed disappeared, to give place to dense and\\r\\nstill boiling eruptive matter of all kinds. The temperature was\\r\\nbecoming unbearable. A thermometer exposed to this atmosphere would\\r\\nhave marked 150 deg.. The perspiration streamed from my body. But for the\\r\\nrapidity of our ascent we should have been suffocated.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Professor gave up his idea of abandoning the raft, and it was\\r\\nwell he did. However roughly joined together, those planks afforded\\r\\nus a firmer support than we could have found anywhere else.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout eight in the morning a new incident occurred. The upward\\r\\nmovement ceased. The raft lay motionless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is this?\" I asked, shaken by this sudden stoppage as if by a\\r\\nshock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a halt,\" replied my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is the eruption checked?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI rose, and tried to look around me. Perhaps the raft itself, stopped\\r\\nin its course by a projection, was staying the volcanic torrent. If\\r\\nthis were the case we should have to release it as soon as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was not so. The blast of ashes, scorix, and rubbish had ceased\\r\\nto rise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has the eruption stopped?\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said my uncle between his clenched teeth, \"you are afraid. But\\r\\ndon\\'t alarm yourself--this lull cannot last long. It has lasted now\\r\\nfive minutes, and in a short time we shall resume our journey to the\\r\\nmouth of the crater.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke, the Professor continued to consult his chronometer, and\\r\\nhe was again right in his prognostications. The raft was soon hurried\\r\\nand driven forward with a rapid but irregular movement, which lasted\\r\\nabout ten minutes, and then stopped again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good,\" said my uncle; \"in ten minutes more we shall be off\\r\\nagain, for our present business lies with an intermittent volcano. It\\r\\ngives us time now and then to take breath.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was perfectly true. When the ten minutes were over we started\\r\\noff again with renewed and increased speed. We were obliged to lay\\r\\nfast hold of the planks of the raft, not to be thrown off. Then again\\r\\nthe paroxysm was over.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have since reflected upon this singular phenomenon without being\\r\\nable to explain it. At any rate it was clear that we were not in the\\r\\nmain shaft of the volcano, but in a lateral gallery where there were\\r\\nfelt recurrent tunes of reaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow often this operation was repeated I cannot say. All I know is,\\r\\nthat at each fresh impulse we were hurled forward with a greatly\\r\\nincreased force, and we seemed as if we were mere projectiles. During\\r\\nthe short halts we were stifled with the heat; whilst we were being\\r\\nprojected forward the hot air almost stopped my breath. I thought for\\r\\na moment how delightful it would be to find myself carried suddenly\\r\\ninto the arctic regions, with a cold 30 deg. below the freezing point. My\\r\\noverheated brain conjured up visions of white plains of cool snow,\\r\\nwhere I might roll and allay my feverish heat. Little by little my\\r\\nbrain, weakened by so many constantly repeated shocks, seemed to be\\r\\ngiving way altogether. But for the strong arm of Hans I should more\\r\\nthan once have had my head broken against the granite roof of our\\r\\nburning dungeon.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have therefore no exact recollection of what took place during the\\r\\nfollowing hours. I have a confused impression left of continuous\\r\\nexplosions, loud detonations, a general shaking of the rocks all\\r\\naround us, and of a spinning movement with which our raft was once\\r\\nwhirled helplessly round. It rocked upon the lava torrent, amidst a\\r\\ndense fall of ashes. Snorting flames darted their fiery tongues at\\r\\nus. There were wild, fierce puffs of stormy wind from below,\\r\\nresembling the blasts of vast iron furnaces blowing all at one time;\\r\\nand I caught a glimpse of the figure of Hans lighted up by the fire;\\r\\nand all the feeling I had left was just what I imagine must be the\\r\\nfeeling of an unhappy criminal doomed to be blown away alive from the\\r\\nmouth of a cannon, just before the trigger is pulled, and the flying\\r\\nlimbs and rags of flesh and skin fill the quivering air and spatter\\r\\nthe blood-stained ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nSUNNY LANDS IN THE BLUE MEDITERRANEAN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I opened my eyes again I felt myself grasped by the belt with\\r\\nthe strong hand of our guide. With the other arm he supported my\\r\\nuncle. I was not seriously hurt, but I was shaken and bruised and\\r\\nbattered all over. I found myself lying on the sloping side of a\\r\\nmountain only two yards from a gaping gulf, which would have\\r\\nswallowed me up had I leaned at all that way. Hans had saved me from\\r\\ndeath whilst I lay rolling on the edge of the crater.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where are we?\" asked my uncle irascibly, as if he felt much injured\\r\\nby being landed upon the earth again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hunter shook his head in token of complete ignorance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it Iceland?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Nej,_\" replied Hans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! Not Iceland?\" cried the Professor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hans must be mistaken,\" I said, raising myself up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was our final surprise after all the astonishing events of our\\r\\nwonderful journey. I expected to see a white cone covered with the\\r\\neternal snow of ages rising from the midst of the barren deserts of\\r\\nthe icy north, faintly lighted with the pale rays of the arctic sun,\\r\\nfar away in the highest latitudes known; but contrary to all our\\r\\nexpectations, my uncle, the Icelander, and myself were sitting\\r\\nhalf-way down a mountain baked under the burning rays of a southern\\r\\nsun, which was blistering us with the heat, and blinding us with the\\r\\nfierce light of his nearly vertical rays.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not believe my own eyes; but the heated air and the sensation\\r\\nof burning left me no room for doubt. We had come out of the crater\\r\\nhalf naked, and the radiant orb to which we had been strangers for\\r\\ntwo months was lavishing upon us out of his blazing splendours more\\r\\nof his light and heat than we were able to receive with comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen my eyes had become accustomed to the bright light to which they\\r\\nhad been so long strangers, I began to use them to set my imagination\\r\\nright. At least I would have it to be Spitzbergen, and I was in no\\r\\nhumour to give up this notion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Professor was the first to speak, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, this is not much like Iceland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But is it Jan Mayen?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor that either,\" he answered. \"This is no northern mountain; here\\r\\nare no granite peaks capped with snow. Look, Axel, look!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAbove our heads, at a height of five hundred feet or more, we saw the\\r\\ncrater of a volcano, through which, at intervals of fifteen minutes\\r\\nor so, there issued with loud explosions lofty columns of fire,\\r\\nmingled with pumice stones, ashes, and flowing lava. I could feel the\\r\\nheaving of the mountain, which seemed to breathe like a huge whale,\\r\\nand puff out fire and wind from its vast blowholes. Beneath, down a\\r\\npretty steep declivity, ran streams of lava for eight or nine hundred\\r\\nfeet, giving the mountain a height of about 1,300 or 1,400 feet. But\\r\\nthe base of the mountain was hidden in a perfect bower of rich\\r\\nverdure, amongst which I was able to distinguish the olive, the fig,\\r\\nand vines, covered with their luscious purple bunches.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was forced to confess that there was nothing arctic here.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the eye passed beyond these green surroundings it rested on a\\r\\nwide, blue expanse of sea or lake, which appeared to enclose this\\r\\nenchanting island, within a compass of only a few leagues. Eastward\\r\\nlay a pretty little white seaport town or village, with a few houses\\r\\nscattered around it, and in the harbour of which a few vessels of\\r\\npeculiar rig were gently swayed by the softly swelling waves. Beyond\\r\\nit, groups of islets rose from the smooth, blue waters, but in such\\r\\nnumbers that they seemed to dot the sea like a shoal. To the west\\r\\ndistant coasts lined the dim horizon, on some rose blue mountains of\\r\\nsmooth, undulating forms; on a more distant coast arose a prodigious\\r\\ncone crowned on its summit with a snowy plume of white cloud. To the\\r\\nnorthward lay spread a vast sheet of water, sparkling and dancing\\r\\nunder the hot, bright rays, the uniformity broken here and there by\\r\\nthe topmast of a gallant ship appearing above the horizon, or a\\r\\nswelling sail moving slowly before the wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis unforeseen spectacle was most charming to eyes long used to\\r\\nunderground darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where are we? Where are we?\" I asked faintly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans closed his eyes with lazy indifference. What did it matter to\\r\\nhim? My uncle looked round with dumb surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, whatever mountain this may be,\" he said at last, \"it is very\\r\\nhot here. The explosions are going on still, and I don\\'t think it\\r\\nwould look well to have come out by an eruption, and then to get our\\r\\nheads broken by bits of falling rock. Let us get down. Then we shall\\r\\nknow better what we are about. Besides, I am starving, and parching\\r\\nwith thirst.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDecidedly the Professor was not given to contemplation. For my part,\\r\\nI could for another hour or two have forgotten my hunger and my\\r\\nfatigue to enjoy the lovely scene before me; but I had to follow my\\r\\ncompanions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe slope of the volcano was in many places of great steepness. We\\r\\nslid down screes of ashes, carefully avoiding the lava streams which\\r\\nglided sluggishly by us like fiery serpents. As we went I chattered\\r\\nand asked all sorts of questions as to our whereabouts, for I was too\\r\\nmuch excited not to talk a great deal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are in Asia,\" I cried, \"on the coasts of India, in the Malay\\r\\nIslands, or in Oceania. We have passed through half the globe, and\\r\\ncome out nearly at the antipodes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the compass?\" said my uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, the compass!\" I said, greatly puzzled. \"According to the compass\\r\\nwe have gone northward.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has it lied?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surely not. Could it lie?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unless, indeed, this is the North Pole!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, it is not the Pole; but--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, here was something that baffled us completely. I could not tell\\r\\nwhat to say.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now we were coming into that delightful greenery, and I was\\r\\nsuffering greatly from hunger and thirst. Happily, after two hours\\'\\r\\nwalking, a charming country lay open before us, covered with olive\\r\\ntrees, pomegranate trees, and delicious vines, all of which seemed to\\r\\nbelong to anybody who pleased to claim them. Besides, in our state of\\r\\ndestitution and famine we were not likely to be particular. Oh, the\\r\\ninexpressible pleasure of pressing those cool, sweet fruits to our\\r\\nlips, and eating grapes by mouthfuls off the rich, full bunches! Not\\r\\nfar off, in the grass, under the delicious shade of the trees, I\\r\\ndiscovered a spring of fresh, cool water, in which we luxuriously\\r\\nbathed our faces, hands, and feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst we were thus enjoying the sweets of repose a child appeared\\r\\nout of a grove of olive trees.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" I cried, \"here is an inhabitant of this happy land!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was but a poor boy, miserably ill-clad, a sufferer from poverty,\\r\\nand our aspect seemed to alarm him a great deal; in fact, only half\\r\\nclothed, with ragged hair and beards, we were a suspicious-looking\\r\\nparty; and if the people of the country knew anything about thieves,\\r\\nwe were very likely to frighten them.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as the poor little wretch was going to take to his heels, Hans\\r\\ncaught hold of him, and brought him to us, kicking and struggling.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle began to encourage him as well as he could, and said to him\\r\\nin good German:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Was heiszt diesen Berg, mein Knablein? Sage mir geschwind!_\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(\"What is this mountain called, my little friend?\")\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well,\" said my uncle. \"I infer that we are not in Germany.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put the same question in English.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe got no forwarder. I was a good deal puzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is the child dumb?\" cried the Professor, who, proud of his knowledge\\r\\nof many languages, now tried French: \"_Comment appellet-on cette\\r\\nmontagne, mon enfant?_\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSilence still.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now let us try Italian,\" said my uncle; and he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Dove noi siamo?_\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, where are we?\" I impatiently repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was no answer still.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you speak when you are told?\" exclaimed my uncle, shaking the\\r\\nurchin by the ears. \"_Come si noma questa isola?_\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"STROMBOLI,\" replied the little herdboy, slipping out of Hans\\' hands,\\r\\nand scudding into the plain across the olive trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were hardly thinking of that. Stromboli! What an effect this\\r\\nunexpected name produced upon my mind! We were in the midst of the\\r\\nMediterranean Sea, on an island of the AEolian archipelago, in the\\r\\nancient Strongyle, where AEolus kept the winds and the storms chained\\r\\nup, to be let loose at his will. And those distant blue mountains in\\r\\nthe east were the mountains of Calabria. And that threatening volcano\\r\\nfar away in the south was the fierce Etna.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stromboli, Stromboli!\" I repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle kept time to my exclamations with hands and feet, as well as\\r\\nwith words. We seemed to be chanting in chorus!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a journey we had accomplished! How marvellous! Having entered by\\r\\none volcano, we had issued out of another more than two thousand\\r\\nmiles from Snaefell and from that barren, far-away Iceland! The\\r\\nstrange chances of our expedition had carried us into the heart of\\r\\nthe fairest region in the world. We had exchanged the bleak regions\\r\\nof perpetual snow and of impenetrable barriers of ice for those of\\r\\nbrightness and \\'the rich hues of all glorious things.\\' We had left\\r\\nover our heads the murky sky and cold fogs of the frigid zone to\\r\\nrevel under the azure sky of Italy!\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter our delicious repast of fruits and cold, clear water we set off\\r\\nagain to reach the port of Stromboli. It would not have been wise to\\r\\ntell how we came there. The superstitious Italians would have set us\\r\\ndown for fire-devils vomited out of hell; so we presented ourselves\\r\\nin the humble guise of shipwrecked mariners. It was not so glorious,\\r\\nbut it was safer.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn my way I could hear my uncle murmuring: \"But the compass! that\\r\\ncompass! It pointed due north. How are we to explain that fact?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My opinion is,\" I replied disdainfully, \"that it is best not to\\r\\nexplain it. That is the easiest way to shelve the difficulty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, sir! The occupant of a professorial chair at the Johannaeum\\r\\nunable to explain the reason of a cosmical phenomenon! Why, it would\\r\\nbe simply disgraceful!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as he spoke, my uncle, half undressed, in rags, a perfect\\r\\nscarecrow, with his leathern belt around him, settling his spectacles\\r\\nupon his nose and looking learned and imposing, was himself again,\\r\\nthe terrible German professor of mineralogy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne hour after we had left the grove of olives, we arrived at the\\r\\nlittle port of San Vicenzo, where Hans claimed his thirteen week\\'s\\r\\nwages, which was counted out to him with a hearty shaking of hands\\r\\nall round.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment, if he did not share our natural emotion, at least his\\r\\ncountenance expanded in a manner very unusual with him, and while\\r\\nwith the ends of his fingers he lightly pressed our hands, I believe\\r\\nhe smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLV.\\r\\n\\r\\nALL\\'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch is the conclusion of a history which I cannot expect everybody\\r\\nto believe, for some people will believe nothing against the\\r\\ntestimony of their own experience. However, I am indifferent to their\\r\\nincredulity, and they may believe as much or as little as they please.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Stromboliotes received us kindly as shipwrecked mariners. They\\r\\ngave us food and clothing. After waiting forty-eight hours, on the 31\\r\\nst of August, a small craft took us to Messina, where a few days\\'\\r\\nrest completely removed the effect of our fatigues.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Friday, September the 4th, we embarked on the steamer Volturno,\\r\\nemployed by the French Messageries Imperiales, and in three days more\\r\\nwe were at Marseilles, having no care on our minds except that\\r\\nabominable deceitful compass, which we had mislaid somewhere and\\r\\ncould not now examine; but its inexplicable behaviour exercised my\\r\\nmind fearfully. On the 9th of September, in the evening, we arrived\\r\\nat Hamburg.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot describe to you the astonishment of Martha or the joy of\\r\\nGraeuben.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now you are a hero, Axel,\" said to me my blushing _fiancee,_ my\\r\\nbetrothed, \"you will not leave me again!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked tenderly upon her, and she smiled through her tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can I describe the extraordinary sensation produced by the return\\r\\nof Professor Liedenbrock? Thanks to Martha\\'s ineradicable tattling,\\r\\nthe news that the Professor had gone to discover a way to the centre\\r\\nof the earth had spread over the whole civilised world. People\\r\\nrefused to believe it, and when they saw him they would not believe\\r\\nhim any the more. Still, the appearance of Hans, and sundry pieces of\\r\\nintelligence derived from Iceland, tended to shake the confidence of\\r\\nthe unbelievers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen my uncle became a great man, and I was now the nephew of a great\\r\\nman--which is not a privilege to be despised.\\r\\n\\r\\nHamburg gave a grand fete in our honour. A public audience was given\\r\\nto the Professor at the Johannaeum, at which he told all about our\\r\\nexpedition, with only one omission, the unexplained and inexplicable\\r\\nbehaviour of our compass. On the same day, with much state, he\\r\\ndeposited in the archives of the city the now famous document of\\r\\nSaknussemm, and expressed his regret that circumstances over which he\\r\\nhad no control had prevented him from following to the very centre of\\r\\nthe earth the track of the learned Icelander. He was modest\\r\\nnotwithstanding his glory, and he was all the more famous for his\\r\\nhumility.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo much honour could not but excite envy. There were those who envied\\r\\nhim his fame; and as his theories, resting upon known facts, were in\\r\\nopposition to the systems of science upon the question of the central\\r\\nfire, he sustained with his pen and by his voice remarkable\\r\\ndiscussions with the learned of every country.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor my part I cannot agree with his theory of gradual cooling: in\\r\\nspite of what I have seen and felt, I believe, and always shall\\r\\nbelieve, in the central heat. But I admit that certain circumstances\\r\\nnot yet sufficiently understood may tend to modify in places the\\r\\naction of natural phenomena.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile these questions were being debated with great animation, my\\r\\nuncle met with a real sorrow. Our faithful Hans, in spite of our\\r\\nentreaties, had left Hamburg; the man to whom we owed all our success\\r\\nand our lives too would not suffer us to reward him as we could have\\r\\nwished. He was seized with the mal de pays, a complaint for which we\\r\\nhave not even a name in English.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Farval,_\" said he one day; and with that simple word he left us and\\r\\nsailed for Rejkiavik, which he reached in safety.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were strongly attached to our brave eider-down hunter; though far\\r\\naway in the remotest north, he will never be forgotten by those whose\\r\\nlives he protected, and certainly I shall not fail to endeavour to\\r\\nsee him once more before I die.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo conclude, I have to add that this \\'Journey into the Interior of\\r\\nthe Earth\\' created a wonderful sensation in the world. It was\\r\\ntranslated into all civilised languages. The leading newspapers\\r\\nextracted the most interesting passages, which were commented upon,\\r\\npicked to pieces, discussed, attacked, and defended with equal\\r\\nenthusiasm and determination, both by believers and sceptics. Rare\\r\\nprivilege! my uncle enjoyed during his lifetime the glory he had\\r\\ndeservedly won; and he may even boast the distinguished honour of an\\r\\noffer from Mr. Barnum, to exhibit him on most advantageous terms in\\r\\nall the principal cities in the United States!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was one \\'dead fly\\' amidst all this glory and honour; one\\r\\nfact, one incident, of the journey remained a mystery. Now to a man\\r\\neminent for his learning, an unexplained phenomenon is an unbearable\\r\\nhardship. Well! it was yet reserved for my uncle to be completely\\r\\nhappy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, while arranging a collection of minerals in his cabinet, I\\r\\nnoticed in a corner this unhappy compass, which we had long lost\\r\\nsight of; I opened it, and began to watch it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had been in that corner for six months, little mindful of the\\r\\ntrouble it was giving.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, to my intense astonishment, I noticed a strange fact, and I\\r\\nuttered a cry of surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter?\" my uncle asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That compass!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See, its poles are reversed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Reversed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, they point the wrong way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle looked, he compared, and the house shook with his triumphant\\r\\nleap of exultation.\\r\\n\\r\\nA light broke in upon his spirit and mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See there,\" he cried, as soon as he was able to speak. \"After our\\r\\narrival at Cape Saknussemm the north pole of the needle of this\\r\\nconfounded compass began to point south instead of north.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Evidently!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here, then, is the explanation of our mistake. But what phenomenon\\r\\ncould have caused this reversal of the poles?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The reason is evident, uncle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell me, then, Axel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"During the electric storm on the Liedenbrock sea, that ball of fire,\\r\\nwhich magnetised all the iron on board, reversed the poles of our\\r\\nmagnet!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aha! aha!\" shouted the Professor with a loud laugh. \"So it was just\\r\\nan electric joke!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom that day forth the Professor was the most glorious of savants,\\r\\nand I was the happiest of men; for my pretty Virlandaise, resigning\\r\\nher place as ward, took her position in the old house on the\\r\\nKoenigstrasse in the double capacity of niece to my uncle and wife to\\r\\na certain happy youth. What is the need of adding that the\\r\\nillustrious Otto Liedenbrock, corresponding member of all the\\r\\nscientific, geographical, and mineralogical societies of all the\\r\\ncivilised world, was now her uncle and mine?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Journey to the Interior of the Earth, by\\r\\nJules Verne\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A JOURNEY TO THE INTERIOR ***\\r\\n\\r\\n***** This file should be named 3748.txt or 3748.zip *****\\r\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\r\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/7/4/3748/\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Norman M.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.

The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\r\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\r\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\r\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\r\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n'"
